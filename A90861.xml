            <title>Innocencie appearing, through the dark mists of pretended guilt. Or, A full and true narration of the unjust and illegal proceedings of the commissioners of Berks, (for ejecting scandalous and insufficient ministers) against John Pordage of Bradfield in the same county. In which he is justly vindicated from the unjust and horrid aspersions of blasphemy, divelism or necromancie, scandal in his life, and all things else falsly objected against him by his enemies. Published for the clearing of truth, and the detecting of malice and subtilty, and for the prevention of all mispprehensions that may be caused by any scandalous pamphlets, and false relations of the proceedings in his case. As likewise for the information of all sober-minded Christians touching his judgement in many things of high concernment, and particularly concerning chastity, virginity, apparitions of spirits, visions, communion with the holy angels, the invisible worlds, magistracy, &amp;c. / Written by the said John Pordage.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Prophets,</hi> and Royal <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> And hath not Gods care and protection of his people, in all ages been moſt eminent, though few for number, though weak for power, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible for their outward ſtate and condition? Yet by his <hi>omnipotency</hi> hath he preſerved them in the midſt of <hi>devouring Lyons.</hi> And hath not <hi>Gods</hi> proceedings with all <hi>States, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> with all <hi>Kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, Rulers</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> been according to their dealing with his <hi>people</hi> and their <hi>Families:</hi> If they have dealt
<hi>gently</hi> with them, and have ſuffered them to dwell <hi>quietly</hi> amongſt them, their <hi>Thrones</hi> have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in
<hi>mercy;</hi> but when they have dealt <hi>unkindly</hi> and <hi>rigidly</hi> with them, it hath been their <hi>ruine.</hi> It is not ſimply the having of
<hi>Gods Saints,</hi> nor the <hi>multitude</hi> of them, nor the
<hi>beſt</hi> of them amongſt you; but it is your uſing of them
<hi>kindly,</hi> and your <hi>countenancing</hi> of them, which is your beſt and moſt <hi>conſiderable intereſt:</hi> Even as it is the greateſt danger to <hi>Rulers,</hi> and to the intereſt of <hi>Government,</hi> to deal cruelly and unjuſtly with them; who being as the ſalt of the earth, keep it from <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>ruine.</hi> Now this <hi>truth</hi> you ſhall find clearly held forth throughout the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> that as <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> have proſpered by their care and <hi>protection</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> ſo have they been broken in pieces through their <hi>cruel dealings</hi> with them. Remember the four Kings over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by <hi>Abraham,</hi> remember <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> with the <hi>Asſirian, Grecian, Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Roman Empires;</hi> was it not for their <hi>Tyrannies, cruelties, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſions, perſecutions,</hi> and for their rigid and cruelly ſevere uſage of <hi>Gods Saints,</hi> that they were deſtryed? I beſeech you conſider what a great body of
<hi>Saints</hi> is committed to your <hi>care</hi> in this <hi>Nation;</hi> by theſe I mean not one party of men, for I could not expreſs the

            <p>For a Chriſtians will is perfected no where but in the will of God; and nothing creates perplexity and diſquietneſs of ſpirit, but the contrariety of motion betwixt the will of God and the will of man<hi>:</hi> For when mans will runs croſs to Gods will, he fights againſt his Maker, and brings trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, guilt and miſery upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>How cautious then ought you (eſpecially who ſit in the

<hi>righteous</hi> then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and really, to give ſuch men much power and liberty, who are ſo much confined to people of their own
<hi>stamp</hi> and <hi>model,</hi> and ſo ready to entrench upon the juſt freedom and liberty of others, is neither ſafe nor reaſonable.</p>
            <p>2. In that you have made an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the
<hi>Ejecting</hi> of <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Ignorant Ministers,</hi> which by the <hi>abuſe</hi> of it, hath been, and ſtill is made an
<hi>Engine</hi> of perſecution, to condemn <hi>Saints,</hi> and throw them out of their <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>livelihoods;</hi> and really I cannot ſee what elſe was like to come of it; it being intruſted into the hands of many fierce, rigid, narrow ſpirited men, who have in ſome things a kind of <hi>unlimited arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power;</hi> as in their Judgement of Ignorance and Inſufficiency, and this without any <hi>Appeal</hi> for the redreſs of thoſe who may be unjuſtly condemned and ejected by them. Now what ſad inconveniences may yet flow from this <hi>Ordinance</hi> thus
<hi>establiſhed</hi> is apparent, by conſidering the rigid temper of thoſe <hi>Commisſioners</hi> who are moſt active, and the late
<hi>prastices</hi> of ſome of them, againſt thoſe who in ſpiritual
<hi>knowledg,</hi> and a holy <hi>converſation,</hi> are beyond themſelves. And in truth you will find by <hi>experience,</hi> that the
<hi>Commisſioners,</hi> who are moſt active, will, as they now do, and have done already, I ſay will turn the <hi>edge</hi> of their <hi>power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that enjoy any glorious <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> above and beyond their <hi>ſystemes</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> and judge thoſe Scandalous and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that differ from them in <hi>judgement,</hi> though they be of ever ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a
<hi>converſation.</hi> And thus many <hi>pretious Saints</hi> will lie under the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb facs="tcp:170626:3"/> of <hi>Ejectment,</hi> pretended <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>ignoaance,</hi> becauſe they ſee not <hi>by</hi> the ſame
<hi>meaſure</hi> of light, nor believe in one proportion of faith, nor give ſuch <hi>interpretations</hi> and <hi>gloſſes</hi> of Scripture as ſuit to their <hi>darkneſs:</hi> And thus the <hi>civil power</hi> received from
<hi>God</hi> for the puniſhment of evil doers, is, and will be uſed againſt the more ſpiritual <hi>adminiſtrations</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the all-glorious Spirit of <hi>Revelation,</hi> pure <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> muſt be made ſubject to the <hi>Laws, Ordinances, Forms, Meaſures,</hi> and <hi>Wils</hi> of men: And is not this to limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And will not the eſtabliſhment of ſuch Laws, left to the <hi>arbitrary</hi> uſe of ſuch <hi>Judges,</hi> without any
<hi>further appeal,</hi> deſtroy that due <hi>Libeity,</hi> both
<hi>civil</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> which is the <hi>beſt Intereſt</hi> of States and Nations? How much then doth it concern you, who are entruſted with the <hi>Government</hi> of this Nation, ſeriouſly and ſpeedily to reflect upon, and conſider the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and thoſe in whoſe hand it is put, being it hath been, is, and is like further to be made uſe of againſt the <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>moſt high;</hi> I ſay, how much doth it concern you, by <hi>reflecting</hi> upon theſe things, to make ſome ſpeedy redreſs, either by <hi>limiting</hi> the arbitrary Power of the <hi>Commisſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and granting an <hi>Appeal,</hi> or
<hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>nulling</hi> the <hi>Ordinance.</hi> And that there is great reaſon for the ſpeedy performance of ſome ſuch thing, will appear by looking into the <hi>ſubſequent Relation</hi> of my
<hi>Tryal,</hi> in which you may ſee <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>ſubtilty</hi> meeting in my accuſations, <hi>partiality</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> appearing in managing the Examinations, with <hi>injustice</hi> and
<hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> concurring in ſentence and condemnation. And I really believe, had you ſeen this true <hi>Narration</hi> of my <hi>Caſe,</hi> before I had appealed for a <hi>re-hearing,</hi> it would have been ſo different from theſe falſe and abuſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of my
<hi>enemies</hi> (by which they have ſubtilly endeavoured to prejudice you, and all others againſt me) and ſo much tending to clear my innocency, that certainly you would have favoured a righteous Cauſe and me ſo much, as to have granted are-hearing. But my <hi>addreſſes</hi> have yet been fruſtrate, and my <hi>Petition</hi> rejected; but upon what grounds, is beſt known to your <hi>conſciences.</hi> I muſt here therefore take the
<hi>boldneſs</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed in my ſpirit, by reflecting upon the
<hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the juſt <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts</hi> of many
<hi>Saints,</hi> and your own good) to put you in mind of thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<hi>proteſtations</hi> and engagements, made before this preſent
<hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of that ſolemn and <hi>publick Oath,</hi> taken at the beginning of this Government, to ſee <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice equally adminiſtred,</hi> and the Saints due <hi>Intereſts</hi> and
<hi>Liberty</hi> preſerved, and of ſome paſſages in your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes late Speech, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That you deſired not to keep the Government any longer then you may preſerve <hi>England</hi> in its juſt Rights, and may protect the people of God in a juſt Liberty of their conſciences. And that
<note n="b" place="margin">p. 20, 21.</note> it is your glory that you know a cauſe, which yet you have not loſt, but do hope you ſhall take a little pleaſure rather to loſe your life, then loſe; which Cauſe your Highneſs had before expreſſed, to be the intereſt of thoſe who have an intereſt in a better world, and their liberty to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the freedome of their conſciences, and freedome in their Eſtates and perſons.</q> Now theſe Engagements, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, and Declarations, are
<hi>eminently</hi> good and <hi>righteous,</hi> and worthy to be
<hi>recorded</hi> in <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> to be ſeriouſly
<hi>reviewed</hi> by you, and I hope may prove inſtrumental to ſtirr you up to the taking of ſome <hi>courſe</hi> (in reference to the Ordinance for
<hi>Ejecting of Miniſters;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170626:4"/> made by you) which may be <hi>ſuitable</hi> to, and
<hi>correſpond</hi> with all theſe open <hi>proteſtations,</hi> and ſolemn <hi>ingagements.</hi> For, whether the leaving it, as now it is eſtabliſhed without any <hi>appeal,</hi> though in point of the greateſt
<hi>injury;</hi> I ſay, whether the leaving of it ſo, be not contrary to the former <hi>proteſtations,</hi> I <hi>appeal</hi> to your own
<hi>conſciences.</hi> For when ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Governors ſhal turn the edge of it againſt the <hi>meek lambs of Chriſts Fold,</hi> who walk faithfully before <hi>God,</hi> and righteouſly toward their <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and make uſe of it to ruine them and their <hi>Families</hi> againſt the
<hi>Law</hi> of this Nation, the <hi>rule</hi> of equity, and the juſt
<hi>liberty</hi> of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and perſons: I ſay, when theſe things are ſo, and yet <hi>no Appeal</hi> admitted by the <hi>higher Powers</hi> for redreſs, 'tis clear that <hi>Iuſtice</hi> is not
<hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually adminiſtred,</hi> and neither the <hi>Spiritual</hi> nor
<hi>Civil</hi> right of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> preſerved. And truely if this ſhould continue, ſome of the <hi>dear Saints</hi> of God would find their conditions more ſad (as to this particular) then it was in the time of the
<hi>Biſhops Perſecutions,</hi> when there were <hi>Courts of Appeal</hi> for thoſe that were oppreſſed and injured, and would be driven as in
<hi>thoſe times</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Speech, p. 18.</note> to ſeek their <hi>bread</hi> from <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and live in
<hi>howling</hi> Wilderneſſes, and be otherwiſe abuſed and made the

And truely there be ſome already, who are of ſound <hi>Principles,</hi> and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable <hi>converſation,</hi> that are perſecuted as <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> and <hi>evil doers,</hi> and ſo oppreſſed by thoſe, who in the <hi>Biſhops</hi> times cryed out for
<hi>Liberty,</hi> as then oppreſſed themſelves: The <hi>baſeneſs</hi> and evil of which practice, your <hi>Highneſe</hi> condemns in your late
<note n="d" place="margin">p. 18.</note> Speech. Except then, that you and your <hi>Councel</hi> either break the <hi>power</hi> of thoſe fierce men, or grant an <hi>Appeal</hi> to ſome of more <hi>large and tender ſpirits,</hi> all the <hi>evils</hi> and hainous <hi>ſins,</hi> which cannot but be committed in the <hi>perſecuting, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and

<hi>unavoidably</hi> revolve and bring <hi>guilt</hi> upon you all, becauſe they act from your power, and may be <hi>ſtrained</hi> when you
<hi>pleaſe.</hi> But whatever you ſhall hereafter act in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this (though many cannot but expect either the <hi>nulling</hi> or
<hi>limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Ordinance</hi> by an <hi>Appeal)</hi> I have diſcharged my <hi>conſcience</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting theſe things to be conſidered of in reference to your own <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the
<hi>good</hi> of others, who may (by ſufferings) be concerned in it, as alſo performed my duty, (as to my own Caſe) in appealing to you, and preſenting my grievance, in expectation of <hi>redreſs;</hi> but whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity and juſtneſs of my cauſe, did not call for more then a <hi>reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of my due requeſt, let all ſober Chriſtians and your own <hi>conſciences</hi> judge. And I pray God this
<hi>denial</hi> be not laid to your charge in the day of <hi>viſitation.</hi> And if you yet perſiſt in the <hi>reſolutions</hi> of granting me no Appeal, and giving me wholly up to the <hi>oppresſion</hi> and

<hi>Chriſt?</hi> God forbid! I mean not ſo: But this I ſay, that every Saint being a member, and ſo a <hi>part of Chriſt,</hi> what is done to the leaſt of his, is done to him: and therefore what you have acted againſt that life of <hi>Innocency, purity,</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> which (by the grace of God) dwells in me, you have acted againſt the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore what can be ſaid, but that ye are the children and followers of thoſe, who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſlew thoſe that were ſent to them from <hi>God,</hi> not ſparing his onely <hi>Begotten Son,</hi> who came to ſave them from their ſins and tranſgreſſions. But theſe perſecutions, brought judgements and deſolations upon the <hi>Authors,</hi> according as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf praedicted, and the event ſhewed; and let me tell you, to whom I write, that if you follow this trade, if you perſevere in this way of <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if you thus lay your hands on your
<hi>fellow-ſervants,</hi> and abuſe them by <hi>ſcandals, reproaches, cenſures, Ejectments,</hi> and <hi>illegal ſequeſtrations,</hi> you will speedily bring <hi>Iudgements, Commotions,</hi> and <hi>Deſolations</hi> upon your ſelves and others. Do but look into the book of the

<hi>kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And what can you expect, but the like judgements, if you continue in ſuch fierce perſecutions. For have you not
<hi>civilly</hi> put me to <hi>death,</hi> having killed my <hi>name</hi> and
<hi>credit,</hi> and blaſted (as much as in you lay) the <hi>purity</hi> and

<hi>diveliſh,</hi> which are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> and the very <hi>glory</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and thoſe perſons <hi>deceivers,</hi> who live moſt in <hi>truth,</hi> and leaſt in the <hi>deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> O what a ſore judgement is this for true
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be ſo <hi>ſtygmatized</hi> by the malice of thoſe, who would be eſteemed ſo, as to be printed, <hi>Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Familiſts, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, Antiſcripturists, Sorcerers,</hi> and what not? And to be proceeded againſt as ſuch, by
<hi>Mulcts,</hi> and <hi>illegal Sequeſtrations,</hi> and all becauſe the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> cannot bow down and worſhip the <hi>Golden Calves</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> that the pretended <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſet up from the <hi>Invention</hi> of their own <hi>Imaginations. Chriſtian Friends,</hi> the world, yea, you your ſelves have wondered at my long
<hi>ſilence,</hi> and well you might, for I have wondred at my <hi>ſelf in it.</hi> For I have long lain under the <hi>rods of mens tongues,</hi> the
<hi>ſtripes of reproaches,</hi> and the burdens of ſad and <hi>heavy cenſures,</hi> and <hi>condemnations;</hi> I have ſeen my ſelf in the
<hi>priſon</hi> of <hi>mens dark Imaginations</hi> and narrow
<hi>Conceptions:</hi> yea, which is more, the <hi>truth of my Faith, purity</hi> of my <hi>principles,</hi> and <hi>innocency</hi> of my
<hi>converſation,</hi> have (as it were) been daſhed in pieces againſt the Rocks of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> by the miſtakes or malice of my <hi>enemies.</hi> So that truly, I may ſay, I have fallen into the hands of ſpiritual <hi>thievs and robbers,</hi> who would have
<hi>plundered</hi> me of that <hi>holineſs, integrity,</hi> and
<hi>uprightneſs,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> hath beſtowed upon me. Yet hitherto I have not opened my mouth, nor pleaded the leaſt, for my own
<hi>Innocency,</hi> I have not <hi>wrote</hi> nor <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gized</hi> for my ſelf in print; but have ſate down in <hi>ſilence,</hi> reſolving to enter into its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Chamber,</hi> till this <hi>Indignation</hi> was overpaſt, believing that by quietly lying down under this <hi>wrath, enmity, oppoſition, condemnation,</hi> and <hi>contradiction</hi> of
<hi>ſinners,</hi> I might in time overcome, and wear it out. Looking upon this as a better way, then to have entred into conteſt by ſetting
<hi>Scripture</hi> againſt <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> againſt <hi>Argument,</hi> which might have more awakened the <hi>Fiery Paſſions</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Whereas quiet retired ſilence, was more likely to have quenched the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
<pb facs="tcp:170626:6"/> of theſe <hi>fires,</hi> and ſtopped the mouths of thoſe <hi>Lyons:</hi> Hence in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive retiredneſs, I have long ſuffered, to ſee whether it might be a ſhelter to me, from the hotter and more <hi>weighty perſecutions</hi> of my enemies. But now this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is paſt. And as there hath been a time to be ſilent, ſo now there is a time to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> that <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>innocency</hi> may no longer ſuffer under the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>error</hi> and <hi>guilt.</hi> For my
<hi>enemies</hi> having proceeded ſo far, as <hi>formally,</hi> and
<hi>actually</hi> to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and condemn me, and (as it were) to
<hi>crucifie</hi> me between <hi>tranſgreſſors, Hereticks, Familiſts, Ranters, Sorcerers:</hi> and endeavouring in <hi>print</hi> to juſtifie their actions, by repreſenting me as guilty of all they lay to my charge, that ſo I might be made a publike <hi>ſpectacle,</hi> and as a prodigious
<hi>ſign</hi> to be gazed and wondred at; I ſay, they having done all this againſt me, and <hi>that life</hi> and <hi>truth of God,</hi> I own and and live to; I could not but publiſh and preſent you with this following
<hi>Relation</hi> of the <hi>proceedings,</hi> wherein I ſhall put an
<hi>Even ballance,</hi> and a <hi>juſt weight,</hi> into your hands, that by it you may be inabled to <hi>weigh</hi> all paſſages betwixt us in
<hi>Juſtice, and Equity,</hi> and ſo diſcern that <hi>ſubtilty, cruelty,</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> of my enemies under which I have ſuffered and do ſtill <hi>ſuffer.—</hi> But, come my <hi>Brethren,</hi> and
<hi>fellow-travellers,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſelves together unto the
<hi>Supper</hi> of the great <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>day</hi> of your
<hi>refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is at hand, the <hi>Bridegrooms</hi> coming is even at the <hi>door,</hi> when all <hi>injuſtice</hi> will be condemned, and all perſecuting <hi>Nimrods</hi> ſummoned to judgement, when they who now
<hi>Lord</hi> it over <hi>Gods inheritance,</hi> and ſolace themſelves in the things of this life, ſhall ſtand trembling and quaking before the
<hi>Judge,</hi> calling for the rocks to fall upon them, and the hills to cover them from the wrath of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> then all their blaſpheming, railing againſt, and reviling the <hi>Saints of God,</hi> and <hi>God in his Saints,</hi> will riſe up in their <hi>Conſciences;</hi> then they will wiſh they had had no being, rather then offended the <hi>little ones</hi> of the kingdom But in thoſe days we ſhall lift up our heads, and ſing for the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and give glory to our
<hi>Redeemer.</hi> But in the mean time, it is enough to conſider, that thus perſecuted they the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> and
<hi>Martyrs</hi> in ages paſt, ſpeaking all manner of evil againſt them for <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> ſake. It is enough to remember, that thus, even thus, muſt all <hi>Chriſts</hi> eminent <hi>witneſſes</hi> be
<hi>civilly</hi> killed in their honor, names, and reputation; thus condemned, thus caſt out of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and thus injured in their eſtates. <hi>But</hi> thorow all theſe <hi>ſufferings,</hi> the ſpirit of glory will be honored: our <hi>royal gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> as our
<hi>faith, love, meekneſs, humility, patience, courage, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> tryed, exerciſed, and ſtrengthened. <hi>Precious friends,</hi> Labour to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> coming towards you in all theſe clouds of <hi>dark perſecutions;</hi> and know that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath his way in theſe whirl-winds, troubles, and confuſions; and that all theſe ſtorms and tempeſts, raiſed up by the powers of darkneſs, imbodying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>natures</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> are but the fulfilling of thoſe Scriptures ſpoken by our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> in which he propheſied of the <hi>Saints ſuffering,</hi> as preparatory to his <hi>ſecond coming in power and glory;</hi> by which theſe <hi>mountains</hi> of oppoſition will be removed, and theſe <hi>Hills</hi> of contention melt away, and the wicked earth, that bringeth forth theſe <hi>Bryers and Thorns</hi> of fleſhly ſtrife and paſſion be burnt up and conſumed. Oh who may abide the
<hi>day</hi> of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he <hi>appeareth?</hi> who ſhall aſcend into the <hi>Holy hill of the Lord,</hi> or abide in the
<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> of his <hi>Glory?</hi> They that walk <hi>uprightly</hi> and work righteouſneſs, and ſpeak the <hi>truth</hi> in their hearts, they that backbite not with their <hi>tongues,</hi> and do no evil to their
<hi>neighbours.</hi> They that do theſe things ſhall never be moved. Now you <hi>heirs</hi> of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to this <hi>kingdom</hi> of
<hi>glory,</hi> to this incorruptible inheritance, to this exceeding, exceſſive, external weight of <hi>Glory,</hi> I deſire you to turn your
<hi>Eys;</hi> that having ſuch great and precious promiſes, you cleanſe your ſelves from all the filthineſs of <hi>fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> perfecting <hi>holineſs</hi> in the fear of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that ſo you may be preſented holy, unblamable, and unreproveable in his ſight at the

            <p>Accordingly at the time prefixed I appeared, about nine of the clock in the morning, in the place above expreſſed, where I waited till betwixt three and four of the clock before I was called in; then came the Door-keeper to tell me, that the Commiſſioners called for me.</p>
            <p>I preſently obeyed, and followed their ſervant, with two friends, that accompanied me; then the Door-keeper commanded my two friends to go forth of the Room; I told him they were to be there: he replyed, that he was ordered by the Commiſſioners to let none in but my ſelf, and therefore they ſhould be put out; and ſo began in an uncivill manner by violence to thruſt them forth: whereupon I applyed my ſelf, to the Commiſſioners, telling them theſe two were my friends, and that I brought them as Eye-witneſſes of the proceedings, and that it was no reaſon I ſhould be alone: To which it was anſwered, they muſt depart, it being reſolved upon by them to have none but my ſelf there preſent. Then the Door-keeper began with violence to pull them forth, crying out, Do you not hear the ſence of the Commiſſioners? I turning towards them again ſaid, I deſired none preſent but theſe my two friends, it was replyed it ſhould not be ſo: upon this I was neceſſitated to ask them, againſt my will, what they were, whether a publick Court of Juſtice, yea or no? for if they were, I demanded the liberty of a Subject, that their Doors might be opened, for all to come in that would, that ſo their proceedings might be open; moreover I ſhewed how this was the Cuſtome of all Committees above, and of all ſuch Courts of Judicature: whereupon the doors were opened, and the people came in; Mr. <hi>Wright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170626:7"/> openly averring, that I ſhould fare the worſe for it; thus was I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to contend for this juſt and reaſonable priviledge, for which my cauſe was unjuſtly threatned.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners then ſitting, were theſe, with one or two more, Mr. <hi>Fettiplace</hi> Chairman, Mr. <hi>Samuell Wightwicke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuell Dunch,</hi> Major <hi>Fincher,</hi> Major <hi>Allin,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cox,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stroud,</hi> Mr. <hi>Angell Bell.</hi> The Miniſters were theſe, with ſome other, Mr. <hi>Hewes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tickle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, as I ſtood ſilent before them, Mr.
<hi>Dunch</hi> turned to me, and with much ſeeming bitterneſs and paſſion, ſpake thus, Dare you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt to be God? and again, how dare you deny the God-head of Chriſt? To whom I replyed, I came to know my charge, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt me, and that I hoped, he had not judg'd my cauſe before it was heard.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Chairman commanded Langly the Clerk, to read theſe following Articles in open Court.</p>

                        <list>
                           <item>1. That the fiery Deity of Chriſt, mingles and mixes it ſelf with our fleſh.</item>

                           <item>3. That the diſcoveries of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, the terrors of the law, the death of Chriſt, the free-grace of God, are fleſhly and flaſhy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</item>
                           <item>4. That the liberty and freedom ſpoken of, purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, and applyed by the dinging and cleaving of the ſoul to, is not a liberty or freedom from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the law, the wrath of God, but the fiery Deity of Chriſt in the center of our ſouls.</item>
                           <item>5. That by Male and Female, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. we are to underſtand by Male, the Deity, by the Female, the humanity, and that theſe two became one fleſh; theſe things were delivered without any limitation whatſoever.</item>
                           <item>6. That gifts and graces of the Spirit, are but fleſh.</item>
                           <item>7. That Chriſt is a Type, and but a Type.</item>
                           <item>8. That Chriſt is not God.</item>

            <p>After theſe Articles were read, the Chair-man demanded my anſwer; to whom I replyed, That I had been acquitted from all theſe, four years ſince, by the Committee of plundered Miniſters, and that after a full hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and debate; therefore I deſired that (according to Law) they would paſs by theſe old ones; but if they had any that were new, told them, I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to receive and anſwer them. I further replyed, I hoped they would give me the liberty of a Felon, who after tryall and acquitment, cannot be queſtioned for the ſame thing again; to which Mr. <hi>Dunch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, with much ſeeming fierceneſs, You are worſe then a Felon, for ought I know. Which language, coming from a Judge to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, before tryall, let all ſober perſons judge of, who are acquainted with the rules of civility, morality, or Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170626:7"/> Here Mr. <hi>Hewes</hi> the Miniſter interpoſed, affirming, That a Felon might be acquitted at one Aſſizes, and hang for the ſame thing at the next; of which he gave an inſtance in a ſtory not worth the relating. To which I replyed only this, That it could not be for the ſame he was acquitted of before; but I ſeeing that he had gone
<hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> beyond his Office, and beyond reaſon, ſaid no more to him, though he was very bitter and pragmatical, ſpeaking oft as Judge, although he was but an aſſiſtant, and that only in reference to ignorance and inſufficiency.</p>
            <p>But afterward applying my ſelf to the Chairman, I further urged, that theſe Articles were not within the cognizance of the Commiſſioners, in that I had been diſcharged from them, by thoſe who had full power and authority to do it.</p>
            <p>After this, all were commanded to withdraw; and about an hour after, I was called in again, and asked for my diſcharge: I anſwered, I came now only to know my Charge; and that I had not my Diſcharge there, but would bring it when they would appoint me.</p>
            <p>Then they declared, That notwithſtanding my Diſcharge in another Court; yet it was the judgement of the Commiſſioners, that they had power to take cognizance of the Articles exhibited, whence they made this Order, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Afterward they asked me how they ſhould know that this was a true Copy? I returned anſwer, I received it from their Clerk, there preſent, who knew it to be true: And beſides, I had a friend by, who being with me when I received it, could atteſt the truth of it by Oath. Then they waved my Diſcharge, and called for my particular Anſwer to the Articles; alleadging, That notwithſtanding the Diſcharge, the Commiſſioners had judged the Articles under their cognizance: So that after I had preſſed my Diſcharge with as much earneſtneſs as in modeſty I could, they ſtill haſtily calling for my further Anſwer, I was neceſſitated to give in this which followeth.</p>

                        <head>My Anſwer to the Articles exhibited againſt me, conſiſts in theſe Particulars.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Partic.</hi> I Humbly conceive, that none of the Articles exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, are comprehended in the Act, Entituled,
<hi>An Act againſt ſeveral Atheiſtical, Blaſphemous, and execrable Opinions, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Honour of God, and deſtructive to humane ſociety;</hi> without the ſenſe and meaning of the words expreſſed in the Act, be ſtretched and wreſted beyond the litteral ſcope and drift of the Act. And this is not my judgement only, but the judgement of ſome pious and judicious Lawyers of this Land: Which thing in all humility, I leave to your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſiderations.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Partic.</hi> I humbly conceive that the forementioned Act cannot take into cognizance thoſe Articles exhibited againſt me, becauſe they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the accuſers, to have been uttered a year before this Act had a birth in the world. Now can any guilt be legally imputed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law, before the original being of it? This ſeemeth contrary to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170626:8"/> reaſon. Now thoſe Articles were charged upon me <hi>Aug.</hi> 16. 1649. and this Act made and publiſhed
<hi>Aug.</hi> 9. 1650.</p>
                        <p>Moreover theſe Articles are not puniſhable by that Act, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the concluſion of the ſaid Act, no perſon is to be impeached, moleſted, troubled, or puniſhed for any offence mentioned in that Act, unleſs he be for the ſame offence accuſed, preſented, indicted, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed within ſix months after ſuch offence committed: Now it is ſix years ſince ſome, and four ſince any of theſe expreſſions were pretended to be uttered by me.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Partic.</hi> I humbly conceive that the forementioned Act cannot take into cognizance the Articles exhibited againſt me, becauſe upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Witneſſes on both ſides, I was cleared by the Vote of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Committee of <hi>Berks,</hi> who had full power by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to put out, and to put in Miniſters in this County.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Partic.</hi> I humbly conceive that the forementioned Act cannot take into cognizance the Articles exhibited againſt me, becauſe after examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Witneſſes, and after a full hearing, I have been diſmiſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from all guilt and offence charged upon me from them, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Committee of Plundred Miniſters, who had full power to put out, and to keep and put in Miniſters. Now the judicious Lawyer ſaith, that theſe Articles having had their original dependance before two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Parliament, who had an abſolute power by Act and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament, to put out, and put in Miniſters; and they having cleared and acquitted me from the pretended guilt of ſuch Articles, it is not according to the liberty of the Subject, or tenor of the Law, that it ſhould be within the cognizance of this Act, or of this Committee, it being againſt that fundamental maxim of <hi>Magna Charta, Nemobis pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metur pro uno delicto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover it ſeemeth contrary to the ſixth Article in the <hi>Inſtrument of Government,</hi> publiſhed by his Highneſs the Lord Protectors ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in which it is expreſſed, <hi>That the Laws ſhall not be altered, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abrogated, or repealed, but by conſent of Parliament, ſave as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the thirtieth Article:</hi> Therefore my former legal Diſcharge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former Acts and Ordinances of Parliament, is ſtill in force, and holds good, not being abrogated by the Government, or by any thing expreſſed or included in the ſaid 30 Article of Parliament.</p>

                           <p n="2">
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Part.</hi> Though I do acknowledg that ſuch expreſſions fell from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170626:9"/> me, yet I never avowedly uttered or maintained ſuch Propoſitions; for they were only uttered by way of diſpute, and that upon this occaſion. Mr. <hi>Daniel Blagrave</hi> then being Chairman of the Committee, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> what Blaſphemy was?
<note n="*" place="margin">This relation I give to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance, as true, though Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, as you ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> He anſwered, Evil ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God the Father. I replyed, A lame definition of Blaſphemy; had Mr.
<hi>Tickle</hi> ſaid, Evil ſpeakings againſt God, which is a word implying the Trinity in Unity, then there had been no occaſion given of conteſt; for the ground of theſe expreſſions aroſe from the weakneſs of his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Blaſphemy, in that he ſaid, Blaſphemy was evil ſpeaking againſt God the Father. To which I reply'd, His definition of Blaſphemy doth not reach that of which he accuſed me; for that which he chargeth me with, is not Blaſphemy againſt God the Father, but againſt Chriſt, God the Son: And I have uttered no evil ſpeakings againſt God the Son; but ſeemingly to my accuſer, in ſaying that his imputative righteouſneſs would prove a ſapleſs righteouſneſs, to all thoſe that had not the Fiery Deity of Chriſt in the centre of their ſouls, burning up their luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> then replyed to the Committee, Pray take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the Dr. denieth that Chriſt is God, which I prove out of <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. To which I replyed, Chriſt was not God the Father, but God the Son; Chriſt is Jehovah, and ſo called the Lord our righteouſneſs, ſaid Mr. <hi>Tickle.</hi> To which I replyed, Chriſt is not Jehovah, if you take Jehovah for the perſon of the Father. And this is the truth, as the whole Committee of <hi>Berks</hi> then preſent, can teſtifie, by whoſe Vote I was then cleared of all theſe unworthy aſpertions, and diſmiſſed; and ſince upon proof of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes acquitted and diſmiſſed, and that after a full hearing by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Plundered Miniſters.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Part. Anſ.</hi> I do humbly conceive, that although the former Act did expreſly adjudge and condemn evil ſpeakings, or blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, yet my delivering ſuch expreſſions in an extempory diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was not God, or Jehovah, did not make me obnoxious to the guilt and penalty of that Act, becauſe <hi>p.</hi> 980. and 981. they only are condemned as guilty, who ſhall avowedly profeſs, maintain, or publiſh in word or writing, ſuch or ſuch execrable opinions; which I never did: Nay I profeſs avowedly the contrary, and do declare in the ſincerity of my heart, that the thought never entred into my heart, to deny the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or Deity of Chriſt; but I have avowedly in words maintained, and publiſhed by Preaching, That Chriſt is God, out of that Text <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>The word was made fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> From whence I did maintain and publiſh, That Chriſt was God, coequal, coeternal, and coeſſential with the Father, contrary to all thoſe blaſphemous and execrable opinions, that deny Chriſt to be God. So that now I hope the meer uttering of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, by way of diſpute before a judicious and underſtanding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, doth not make me a tranſgreſſor, according to the true ſenſe and meaning of this Act.</p>

            <p>But this I muſt ſpeak on the behalf of Mr. <hi>Wightwick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn,</hi> that by their preſence, things were tranſacted that day with much more ſeeming modeſty and calmneſs then at other times; the Miniſters then containing themſelves within the limits of due ſilence, which gave me ſome hopes that the latter part of my Tryal might be tranſacted in ſome moderation, equity, and civility; but theſe two ſitting no more after that day, there broke forth much confuſion, raſhneſs, and incivility in their carriage; ſome Miniſters (who were bitter enemies againſt me) acting the part of Commiſſioners, and ſeeming to have great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their proceedings, being ſuffered to break forth into uncivil ſcoffs, and railings againſt me in the open Court, as it will afterward appear.</p>
            <p>But thus much for my ſecond daies appearance, here repreſented ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the line of truth and equity.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of <hi>November</hi> I appeared before them again at the ſame place, according to their laſt Order, at which time Major

            <p>The firſt thing they demanded of me was, to give in my Anſwer to the ſecond Charge of Articles exhibited the laſt day againſt me: I replyed, that my Anſwer was ready; but I deſired that they would keep to their own Order, and firſt hear my Witneſſes, and ſo finiſh my firſt Charge, that we might not run into confuſion; but they would not hearken to this rational requeſt, importuning me for my Anſwer, reſolving to hear nothing till I had given it in; ſo being neceſſitated to yield to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I gave in this ſubſequent Anſwer.</p>

                        <head>My Anſwer to the ſecond Articles exhibited againſt me, is as followeth.</head>
                        <p>IN the firſt place I ſhall take liberty to reply to the Title of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which is, to prove my ignorance and inſufficiency for the Miniſtry, by the Articles produced.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Part. Anſ.</hi> I do here humbly deſire that ignorance and inſufficiency for the Miniſtry, may be preſerved as diſtinct Heads from Scandal and Hereſie, according as it is intended by the Authors of the Ordinance: for certainly it is againſt the judgement of the Lord Protector, and the intendment of his Councel, who made the Ordinance, to confound that which may be called ſcandal, or hereſie and inſufficiency together: We ſee it is uſual this day amongſt us, for knowing and learned Miniſters to differ in their Judgements, both in Doctrine, Worſhip, and things indifferent; who yet thereupon are not accounted ignorant and inſufficient for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170626:11"/> So that although theſe Articles could be proved true, they are to be referred either to ſcandal or hereſie, and not to ignorance and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Part. Anſ.</hi> If ignorance and inſufficiency for the Miniſtry, be taken for the want of an inward ſpecial gift, as it is qualified with humane Arts and Sciences, attained by much pains and induſtry, in relation to Academical Learning: Or if ignorance and inſufficiency for the Miniſtry, are taken for the want of inward abilities, qualified with ſpiritual gifts, as with thoſe of prayer, utterance and Preaching. Or if ignorance and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency be taken for the want of a ſaving principle of grace, manifeſting it ſelf in convictions of ſin, Legal terrors, or Evangelical illuminations into the free grace &amp; love of the Father, or into the meritorious death of Chriſt for the redemption of loſt ſinners. Or if it be taken for thoſe effects flowing from ſuch a ſaving principle of life, as that of ſaving faith, true repentance, pardon of ſin, peace of conſcience, a holy life in all univerſal obedience, to the holy will and righteous commands of God, Then I humbly conceive, that meer ignorance and inſufficiency, without the pretenſions of Hereſie, and Scandal, will be found a bed too ſhort, and a covering too narrow for my Ejection out of the work of the Miniſtry, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Ordinance.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Part. Anſ.</hi> Hence my humble deſire to you for time to come is, that you would not make your Ephah of ignorance and inſufficiency ſo ſmall, that Hereſie and ſcandal may not ſtand diſtinct in it; and that you would not make your Shekell of ignorance and inſufficiency ſo great, as to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up Hereſie and Scandal, into the boundleſs and endleſs extent of it: For what is this but to falſifie the Ballances of juſtice and equity, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull weight, in not preſerving inſufficiency as a diſtinct head from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Hereſie; which in time may prove very prejudicial to that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, which of late years hath been, and is ſtill preſerved and aſſerted by the Rulers of this Nation.</p>

<hi>Lewins</hi> having children by her husband, for the ſifting forth of truth from error, could it be proved that I did ſo, could argue or evince my ignorance and inſufficiency for the Miniſtry: For this, though it were evinced to be my crime, cannot in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity be referred to that Head of Inſufficiency; but to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, except ignorance and inſufficiency be reſolved into the boundleſs liberty of the wills of the Judges, that what they deem ignorant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, muſt be ignorant and inſufficient, whether ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency be real in ſuch a Subject, or not.</p>

                           <p>As to the firſt part of it, I confeſs that one

<hi>Bradfield,</hi> for the ſpace of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170626:12"/> three weeks, and no longer; and that after this manner: He came in Harveſt-time with a new pair of Harveſt-gloves on his hands, to ſhew his willingneſs and readineſs to work; and asking to ſpeak with me, told me, That if I pleaſed to employ him in Harveſt-work, he came to offer his ſervice: Hereupon I entertained him as a workman.

                              <head>Whereas it is ſaid he was generally reputed a Conjurer.</head>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, I never heard any the leaſt intimation from any, that he was ever ſuſpected to be a Conjurer, till after his departure from my Family; if he was a Conjurer before he came, it was more then I knew, or had heard of; but after his departure I confeſs there aroſe a general report up and down the Country that he was a Conjurer. But from that time to this, I have never ſeen him, nor known what is become of him.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> After his abſence I do further affirm, That I was ſtrongly enclined to believe, according to the general rumor, that he was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer<hi>:</hi> Hereupon I was in a great ſtrait in my own ſpirit, whether I ſhould proſecute him, or not, my zeal for Gods glory, and my obedience to the command of God, that ſaith,
<hi>Suffer not a Witch to live,</hi> giving me ſome impulſions to do it. But after ſerious debate and conſideration within my ſelf, I reſolved this caſe or ſcruple of conſcience thus, that my own perſwaſions and jealouſies, though they had ſome ground of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet being not certain, afforded me not a ſufficient ground of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting him as a Conjurer, or of ſwearing poſitively he was ſuch.

                                 <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, It is well known, as I invite none, ſo I turn away none that come to viſit me, though their Principles in matter of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline be different from mine. I will here ſhew you briefly my grounds and ends: My grounds are theſe; I look upon it as my duty, according to the Goſpel of Chriſt, to entertain all ſtrangers that be in want and neceſſity, profeſſing the name of Chriſt. If ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hunger, we are to feed them, if they are naked, we muſt clothe them; and as for ſtrangers, we are to lodge and entertain them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2. And as in the practice of this I break no Law of God, ſo no Law of man. And you may remember, that in the 37. Article of Government, it is expreſſed, That all ſuch as profeſs Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, though differing in Judgement, from the Doctrine, Worſhip, or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, publickly profeſſed, ſo as they abuſe not this liberty to the civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of others, nor to the actual diſturbance of the Publike Peace, ſhall be protected, and then ſurely their hungry bellies may be fed, their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170626:12"/> backs clothed, their wants ſupplyed, and their perſons lodged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.</p>
                              <p>And further, my ends are theſe, which are pure and Evangelical, That I may prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good, that I may try the ſpirits, for many falſe ſpirits are gone forth into the world. Now how are they to be proved and tryed? Not by carnal weapons, as by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, mulcts, impriſonments, and other external puniſhments; but by convincing of them with ſound Doctrine, Chriſtian diſcourſe, ſpiritual arguments, and by the example of a good converſation: And thus Gods glory, and the good of others are my only ends, in giving entertainment to all ſtrangers that come in civility to viſit me.</p>
                              <p>Now the cauſe of many ſtrangers coming to me as Gueſts from all quarters of this Land, ariſeth from theſe lying printed Pamphlets, which have hardly a word of truth in them, theſe draw all ſeeking enquiring minds to viſit me, for divers ends beſt known to themſelves: Let it but be proved that ever I gave entertainment to any common ſwearer, or to any open drunkard, Sabbath-breaker, or to any known prophane perſon, and I ſhall judge my ſelf obnoxious to your Cenſure; but all that I give free entertainment to, appear clothed under ſome ſhew of Godlineſs or other; but if they have not the power, it will be their own miſery.</p>
                              <p>In a word, the ſtrength of this Article doth but amount to thus much, That as Chriſt was ſuppoſed to be a friend of publicans and ſinners, ſo am I ſuppoſed to be a friend to all people that profeſs Religion, and walk or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, be their opinion in matter of Doctrine or Diſcipline never ſo much differing from mine own, or from thoſe commonly received; yet this doth not argue my ignorance or inſufficiency for the Miniſtry; but if in it any thing be culpable, it is to be referred to the head of Scandal: but here being no Law of prohibition, I cannot ſee any tranſgreſſion in it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Law of God or man.</p>
                              <p>To conclude, I cannot give a more direct Anſwer to theſe Articles, being matter of fact, till I ſee them proved, and each Article referred to its proper place, either of Scandal or Hereſie, or Ignorance and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>

Then I craved liberty to croſs examin him openly, and began to put my Interrogatories to him; but this juſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg they peremptorily denied me, though I uſed many reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſhew the equity and reaſonableneſs of it. Then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to write down my Interrogatories, which ſhould be propoſed and anſwered in private, without my preſence, according to their fixed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Then all being commanded to withdraw, I wrote down my Interrogatories; and when I gave them in, I deſired they might be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the open Court; but it was denied. Then I requeſted that I my ſelf might be preſent at the croſs-examination, though all the reſt withdrew,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170626:13"/> urging, that although I had given in my Interogatories, yet there might be many neceſſary circumſtances and queſtions emergent in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which I could not then give in in writing, nor make uſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out I was preſent, which yet might ſerve very much to clear the truth; but notwithſtanding this, and more which was then ſaid, I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but was commanded to withdraw.</p>
            <p>After this I was called in again, and as I thought to receive Mr.
<hi>Tickles</hi> Anſwers to my Interogatories, which though I preſſed it with much earneſtneſs, was denied, they reſolving, as it ſeemed to me by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to keep them private till publication, which appeared to me very partial dealing, in regard I could not know how the Queſtions were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, againſt the time of making my defence by Negative Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>But afterward importuning the Court to examin my Witneſſes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Order, I was interrupted by their commanding of the Clerk to read a third Charge of Articles exhibited againſt me by Mr.
<hi>Fowler,</hi> an Aſſiſtant Miniſter to the Commiſſioners, whoſe zeal moving ſwifter then the Clerks ſlow reading of the Articles, cauſed him to take them out of his hands, and to read them himſelf, with much courage and reſolution; The Articles were theſe that follow.</p>

<hi>July</hi> 1653. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine of the clock the ſame night, there appeared the viſion of a man ſtanding at her beds feet; on Thurſday the next day he had a book in his hand, and ſtood by her all that day and ſaid nothing.

I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>A wounded conſcience who can bear?</hi> He replyed, He that hath wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, will make thee whole. I ſpake much of mine own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he anſwered, There was worth in Chriſt, and he had paid a ranſom for me. Then he told me that that book in his hand, was the book of the Lamb, and that my name was written in it: I ſaw the book, a broad book with a parchment-cover, and I ſaw writing in it; and then was I lifted up with a great deal of joy. About four of the clock the ſame Friday, the dark Angel came and ſtood by the other Viſion, with a knife in his hand, and ſaid, thou haſt had a great deal of joy; and offering her the knife, bid her diſpatch her ſelf, and ſhe ſhould enter into that erernal reſt her ſoul ſo much thirſted after. Upon this ſhe trembled, the bed ſhook, and my Mrs. held me.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Friday I had viſions preſented upon the Wall, I ſaw the world, and the reſurrection of the dead, and the Son of man appearing in the clouds of heaven.</p>
                        <p>She ſaw clearly the viſion of a friend of hers in
<hi>London</hi> in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Southcot,</hi> her friend was much inclined to this way; ſhe much wondred at it, and told Mrs. <hi>Pordage</hi> of it, who anſwered, alas ſo do we ſee abundance of thoſe we never knew before, when once they come into our way.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday Dr. <hi>Pordage</hi> came to her, being ſent for, and prayed in a very ſtrange language, ſhe did not underſtand well what he ſaid; ſhe heard him ſay, Lord; but nothing of Jeſus Chriſt, but the abiſs and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eternity.</p>
                        <p>She heard a great noiſe of Drums and Trumpets, ſhe asked the Dr. what the ratling of Drums and Trumpets meant? He anſwered, it was an alarm to the Spiritual War.</p>
                        <p>One of the nights ſhe ſaw the viſion of young Mr.
<hi>Daniel Blagrave</hi> which came to her bed-ſide; ſhe took him by the hand, and it felt cold: She asked the Doctor what it meant? He anſwered, The coldneſs of the

                        <p>She asked Dr. <hi>Pordage</hi> what the Viſions meant? He anſwered, They durſt not reveal one anothers Viſions, he did not queſtion but God would diſcover himſelf, and reveal wonderful things to me.</p>
                        <p>She was from Wedneſday noon till Monday noon, and did not eat one piece of bread, but ſometimes a little water and ſugar; and ſhe ſaith ſhe was not ſick at all after the firſt two hours: and when ſhe was about to eat, ſhe had a voice come to her; <hi>We are not to live upon bread, but upon every word of God:</hi> And upon that voice ſhe did not eat.</p>
                        <p>She ſaith that ſhe hath oftentimes ſeen at
<hi>London,</hi> flaſhes of light in her Chamber, and at laſt heard a voice which put her into a very great fear and ſweat, ſaying, Thou haſt married a lump of clay; but thou muſt return to thy firſt husband, who is thy Saviour, and thou muſt go to <hi>Joppa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And upon this ſhe was convinced that theſe viſions were of the Devil, becauſe the voice was clean contrary to the Scriptures. She ſaith that ſhe hath heard it reported at <hi>Southcot,</hi> that ere long Doctor <hi>Pordage</hi> ſhould have power from him to beſtow ſaving graces on whom he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as alſo, that marriage was the way of beaſts.</p>

            <p>After he had done, it ſeemed not enough to him to have read ſuch a horrid, ſcandalous, confuſed Charge to the people againſt me, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſpeak to them, deſiring them to take notice what a ſtrange per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I was, repreſenting me to be guilty of Blaſphemy, Deviliſm, and of looſneſs in my converſation, promiſing to prove that Charge of Articles, or to be counted a Slanderer: after which prevaricating ſpeech, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly departed.</p>

<hi>Grips</hi> houſe, ſhe took me into a private room to have ſome conference with me alone, where ſhe brake forth into a violent paſſion of tears, weeping and wringing her hands, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170626:17"/> pouring ſorth bitter complaints, and invectives againſt Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> as that he was a graceleſs man, a Lyer, a Slanderer, not worthy to come up into a Pulpit, or to have the name of a Miniſter of Chriſt, with other ſuch bitter expreſſions: The cauſe of which was, as ſhe then told me, Mr. <hi>Fowlers</hi> reporting about, that ſhe then lived in Adultery, and after her paſſion was ſomewhat allayed, ſhe brake forth into theſe or ſuch like expreſſions of high aſſurance, Chriſt hath loved me, and dyed for me, and juſtified me by his bloud, from all guilt of ſin, I am an elect perſon, a juſtified perſon, and what is this <hi>Fowler</hi> to charge ſin upon me? Theſe and other expreſſions fell from her to this purpoſe, from ſome of which, I feared ſhe was drenched with Antinomianiſm, and told her more then once, it was a poor thing to live upon the bloud of Chriſt, and to look ſo much upon that, except ſhe had the nature of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt, asking her where was the meekneſs of Chriſt, and the patience of Chriſt, to ſuffer as an innocent lamb quietly? but ſtill ſhe crying out, ſhe lived on the bloud of Chriſt, I told her it was a poor thing to be thus exalted with notions of the bloud of Chriſt, without mentioning ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and thoſe holy graces which flow from Chriſts nature dwelling in the ſoul: Now by theſe expreſſions of mine, my ſcope was to make Mrs. <hi>Grip</hi> ſee the neceſſity of ſanctification, and of a pure and holy life, and not to make void the bleſſed effect of the bloud of Chriſt, applyed according to the mind of God, and the true meaning of the Scripture. And now, having related the circumſtances, as near as I can remember, I believe a ſober and knowing Chriſtian will not judge me either ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or ignorant for theſe expreſſions:</p>

And this afterward I told to the above-mentioned Mrs. <hi>Grip,</hi> in a private conference, ſome years ſince, to whom I affirmed that I found no ſuch expreſſions as perſons in Trinity, in the Scripture, and that the word Perſon being a School-term, was very difficult to be apprehended by common capacities; but I never ſpake thus to prejudice the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons in the ſacred Trinity, which I do cordially believe,

<hi>O death, where is thy ſting! and there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> Whereas trouble for ſin thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and mortified, may be an engine of Satan to make a ſoul queſtion Gods love, and to bring it out of a bleſſed, ſpiritual enjoyment of God, into ſlaviſh fear and diſturbance.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ. Affirm.</hi> ABout nine years ſince I brought behind me from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the fore-mentioned Mrs. <hi>Flavel,</hi> who had been of ancient and near acquaintance with me and my Family, to one Goodman
<hi>Laughtons</hi> a Smith in <hi>Heſſen,</hi> where ſome four or five months after ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, which ſhe owned to the people where ſhe then was, to be by a ſecond husband, even as ſhe ſtill acknowledgeth: And further, that I viſited her three times in the ſpace of three quarters of a year, at Term time, being then ingaged in a Law-Suit that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that one of thoſe times I Chriſtned her child, and called it <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah:</hi> That afterward her occaſions not requiring ſo much privacy, ſhe came to live with her ancient acquaintance at my houſe, where alſo for ſome years her daughter hath been with her.</p>
                        <div type="particulars">
                           <head>Now to take away any thing that may ſeem to reflect upon me in this my acknowledgment, pray conſider theſe ſubſequent particulars.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. THat I and Mrs. <hi>Pordage</hi> being of very near and long acquaintance with her, it was but a friends courteſie, for me upon her deſire, to carry her to this houſe behind me.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That ſhe had ſufficient ground to retire into ſome ſuch place in the Country; firſt in that the City aire was offenſive to her health; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that by the councel of able Lawyers, ſhe was adviſed to retire into ſome private place, ſhe being then in Law-ingagements, and continually ſubjeſt to Arreſts, by the entanglement of her firſt husbands Eſtate, her brother in Law, who was her adverſary, then threatning to ceaze on her if ſhe were above ground.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In reference to my engagement in her Law-buſineſs, I think it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial briefly to relate the ground and occaſion of it. In the time of her widowood, her brother in Law began a Suit with her in the Common Law, which fearing he ſhould there be overthrown, he removed to the Chancery; now ſhe being very unfit and incapable to mannage this her ſelf, ſhe earneſtly deſired me, as an ancient and truſty friend, to undertake it; Upon this I went to Judge <hi>Rowles</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Chute</hi> with her, who looking into her Evidences, and into the will of her late deceaſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, found that for want of one Clauſe in it, ſhe was liable to many Suits and Arreſts, and to great intanglements, and that her Intereſt could not be eſtabliſhed, but by much difficulty; and at length this was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the Councel, That ſhe muſt let all her Eſtate which was under Mortgage, be forfeited into the hand of ſome faithfull friend, and ſo ſell it away; hence I through much importunity, laid down ſome hundred pounds, reſcued the Mortgage, and ſo became intereſted in a Suit at Chancery, which laſted three years.</p>
                           <p>Now from this may further appear ſufficient ground why I brought her to that private houſe, ſecondly why I came to her in the time of her retirment, I then receiving money from her to follow her Suit; thirdly, why I came alone, it being then her Intereſt to be concealed, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Arreſts.</p>

                           <head>I ſhall now proceed to add ſome few circumſtances more, which may ſerve to clear me before all ſober perſons.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. AT my coming, I told the people my name, and that I dwelt at <hi>Reading,</hi> and that I was Miniſter of St
<hi>Lawrence</hi> Church, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gentlewoman to be ſober, and pious. Now had I been as my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies enviouſly pretend, I might have concealed my name, quality, and place of Reſidence.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We diſcovered to them that the Gentlewoman, had an eſtate in the Bulwark at <hi>London,</hi> and Rents there to receive, which they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after (as they did) for their ſecurity; now this was not the way to cover a work of darkneſs.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. She ſometimes went to <hi>London</hi> to the Lawyers, whilſt ſhe was there, ſome belonging to that Family accompanying her, who found, that as ſhe had related, ſhe was in great troubles at Law, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that ſhe returned on that account.</p>
                           <p>Now in reference to moſt of theſe particulars, in which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, and denyed the alleaged circumſtances, and further vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf, they are exactly agreeing with what I have in writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and acknowledged, by <hi>Laughton</hi> himſelf, from whom this charge is pretended to be received, and by the Nurſe of the child, ſubſcribed by them both before witneſſes, which acknowledgement I ſhall produce when I ſee occaſion.</p>
                           <p>And by this I hope it may appear, to moderate, ſober, and judicious men, that this Libelling charge, drawn up ſo falſly, enviouſly and yet ſo ſubtilly, calling from the dead a buſineſs paſt ſome nine or ten years ſince, (which though it were criminous (as it is not) were invalid legally to prejudice, by the Act of Oblivion, or General Pardon, as all other things pretended to be ſpoken or acted by me before
1651. according to the judgement of judicious men, which I leave to the Commiſſioners to conſider of), I ſay; that this is but the effect of the evil and wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of my Accuſer brought forth to prejudice and overcloud that pure, and innocent principle, which I profeſs and faithfully live to; and the better to cover that evil deſign they have againſt my perſon and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                           <p>And now I appeal unto you the Commiſſioners, and to all that are pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſober minded, whether my enemies, do not deal very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, enviouſly, and unbeſeeming Chriſtians, from this buſineſs, ſo long ſince paſt, in which nothing criminous is poſitively objected againſt me, to draw ſuch horrid concluſions, as commonly to report, that I now live in baſe Luſt and wantonneſs, notwithſtanding my commending of, and owning the Virgin-Life, I ſay, whether this be not exceeding hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ungodly dealing, let all judge. But I ſee the deſign of the Devil in it, which, my enemies may be ignorant of, which is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud, and darken, by monſtrous lyes and ſcandals, which are the ſmoak of the bottomleſs pit, that Life of Purity, Chaſtity, Mortification, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, and heavenly injoyments, which God hath favoured me to live in, and ſo to affright all, from my acquaintance, which otherwiſe might very much prejudice, and overthrow his Kingdom. For the old Serpent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170626:23"/> knows very well, as alſo my neer friends and acquaintance, that for theſe four years, even ſince the time of my great tryals, by the extraordinary Temptations, and Repreſentations, of the devil, that I have been abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted more then ordinary, from all outward things, giving my ſelf up whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Prayer, Watchfulneſs, Mortification, and conſtant ſelf-denial, in dying to all earthly pleaſures, even to things permitted, and accounted lawful, as finding many things which ordinarily, are embraced, to be great hinderances of the ſouls progreſs to God, and great burthens to a ſpirit which hath taſted much of that tree of Life, which groweth in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, and great clogs to a ſoul, that ſees through the vail of the ſenſitive Nature, into the Spiritual Glory of Eternity<hi>:</hi> but what I have enjoyed, and experimented in this time of my extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mortification, and ſelf-denyal, in the death of the Animal man, and riſing of Chriſts Image in me, is not ſeaſonable now to declare, yet for the glory of my God, and the undeceiving of thoſe who ſtrangely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, this much in all humility, I muſt ſay, that did my accuſer, and my enemies know, what I have enjoyed in this way of the croſs, of the ſecret hidden treaſures of Eternity, and of the out-goings of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were they but acquainted with theſe diſcoveries of celeſtial Glory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations of the heavenly dew, and ſecret touches of the Holy Ghoſt; did they but know thoſe bright irradiations of Eternal Light, thoſe ſtrong motions of divine Life, and pleaſant ſtreams of eternal Love, together with thoſe deep ſufferings in bearing Chriſts Croſs, which I and many in my Family have in this time experienced, they durſt not thus condemn me and judge me as an evil doer, and one that lives in the Luſts of the fleſh. But my God hath taught me, to Bleſs, whilſt they Curſe, to pray for them, whilſt they deſign to ruine me, and to love them, whilſt they hate me; and to ſay with Chriſt,
<hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This I thought fit, in all humility to annex, to that Libelling charge concerning Mrs <hi>Flavel,</hi> from which I have undeſervedly ſuffered ſo much, by the malice of the devil; and now I ſhall proceed to anſwer the remaining Articles, one of which is intermixed with the former ſeven that concern Mrs <hi>Flavel;</hi> which is this.</p>

               <p>And being further examined by interrogatories, he anſwered to the firſt of them, That this was fully and roundly delivered in my Sermon at

                  <q>Their Evidence was this, which every one in particular, intended to give in, in writing, after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> I do confeſs I was preſent before the Committee of plundred Miniſters, the 27 of <hi>March,</hi> 1651 where I did hear the Doctor upon his examination touching that Article, That the Imputative Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a ſapleſs Righteouſneſs, deliver himſelf to this purpoſe, That to him that hath not the ſpirit of Chtiſt indwelling in his heart by Faith, notwithſtanding all his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and his merits, it is but a ſapleſs Righteouſneſs, ſo ſaith the Scripture, he that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt is none of his.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But this Teſtimony and Evidence the Commiſſioners rejected, and would not ſuffer the witneſſes to depoſe it upon oath.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the next place I certified the Commiſſioners, that I had preſent divers knowing Chriſtians that were conſtant hearers of me, who were ready to depoſe on oath what the ſcope of my Miniſtery was, and what they had frequently heard me hold forth in it, touching Chriſts Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Righteouſneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Commiſſioners rejected this Teſtimony alſo, and would not hear the Evidence of theſe intended witneſſes; ſaying, that it was not to the purpoſe, but meerly dilatory. To which I replyed, that although the proofs were weak and altogether impertinent, yet being Judges, they ought to hear them, and afterward to judge of their force or invalidity, and I further told them, that this proceeding of theirs, in thus preventing and rejecting the teſtimony of my witneſſes, in not ſuffering them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what they could; did much ſtrengthen my belief of the common report ſpread abroad the Country, That they had reſolved beforehand to condemn and eject me, whether by right or wrong. At this Mr <hi>Traphams</hi> choler ſeemed much to be ſtirred, that the Court of which he was one, ſhould thus be charged, ſaying with much paſſion, that this ſhould be looked upon as a contempt and an affront againſt the Court.</p>
               <p>But the Commiſſioners peremptorily reſolving not to take the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the forementioned witneſſes, becauſe it contradicted not Mr. <hi>Tickles</hi> Teſtimony, <hi>quoad idem tempus,</hi> in reference to the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time, I was forced to tell them that I muſt ſubject to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Court, but I hoped they would be more ingenuous and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like, then condemn me for a word or expreſſion, though
<note n="i" place="margin">Which this was not, the witneſſes not being poſitive, having ſome reſerves at you may ſee before</note> proved ever ſo clearly, if the drift and tenor of my Miniſtery were otherwiſe.</p>

               <p>After this I further preſſing the Commiſſioners to hear thoſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which were to atteſt this, they ſeemed ſomewhat to change their reſolution, and to admit one or two of them to be examined.

               <p>And being
<note n="k" place="margin">Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> and ſome of the Miniſters falling upon him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtions, he had not here liberty to ſpeak his full minde.

               <p>(Here, upon this, were many Outcries againſt me, from the Accuſer, and others of the Miniſters and Commiſſioners, as though I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome hainous act in ſuborning a witneſs to ſwear what I pleaſed: whereas there was no ſuch thing, for this man and two more, meeting at my houſe, compared their note books together, out of which this was taken, which was in that paper, which he after mature deliberation and reflection upon it, could with a good Conſcience ſwear to; as looking upon it more ſafe then to ſwear upon ſudden memory.)</p>
               <p>But I ſhall now proceed to the further examination of this witneſs, as it was taken by the Clerk, but very partially, as you ſhall ſee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Richard Higgs</hi> being asked what he meant, or what the Doctor meant by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, he ſaith he cannot depoſe; but the Doctor interpoſing ſaid, Chriſts Righteouſneſs was his active and paſſive obedience, and thereupon the Deponent being
<note n="a" place="margin">Here the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters fell upon him ſo fiercely, and asked him ſo many queſtions that the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, being a modeſt man, ſeemed to be ſomewhat dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, telling them it did not concern him to anſwer to many of their queſtions.</note> asked what was Chriſts active obedience, preſently denyed his words again.</p>
               <p>To this he refuſed to ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Clerk hath left out ſomething, touching <hi>Richard Higgs</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to that queſtion about Chriſts active obedience, which anſwer being caught up by the

               </p>
               <p>After this Mr <hi>Fowler,</hi> the Accuſer, openly atteſted againſt this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, That he denyed the Bible to be the word of God, and ſaid that the ſame was but old declaratives, which the ſaid deponent denies.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Here the Clerks partiality is again apparent, who left out a weighty diſtinction, which the deponent made concerning the word of God in anſwer to Mr <hi>Fowlers</hi> accuſation, which was this; that he never denyed the Scripture or Bible to be the written word, but had ſaid it was not the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170626:26"/> eſſential word: And this very diſtinction the Deponent had formerly given to the Miniſter of the Pariſh, who being preſent, confeſſed it before the Court, acknowledging that he walked like an honeſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſtian in his converſation.</q>

<hi>viz.</hi> Whether this Article was thus expreſſed by me, without any addition or diminution of his own? He thus anſwers,

               <p>
                  <q>But here courteous Reader, you muſt give me leave to ſhew you Mr. <hi>Tickles</hi> uncertainty and diſagreement with himſelf in delivering this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which cannot but make it invalid in the eyes of thoſe that are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In his atteſting of this Article three ſeveral times, he never agreed with himſelf, but either diminiſhed or added. The firſt time he ſware to this Article, he had this clauſe (and applyed by the clinging and cleaving of the ſoul to Chriſt) as you may ſee in the firſt paper of Articles, which being ſworn again <hi>October</hi> 5. he left out, and neither of theſe agreed with his own Depoſition given under his own hand ſome four years ſince to the Committee of Plundered Miniſters, when it was more fleſh in his memory, and yet not delivered ſo fully and poſitively as now, which you may ſee by his own words (taken out of his former Depoſitions) which were theſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">This was the repeating of ſome paſſages in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though in a miſtake, as you will ſee afterward.</note> Another preparation was the inſtating of the ſoul into a glorious liberty and freedom in theſe expreſſions: Which liberty and freedom is not that liberty and freedom from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, brought about (or in an expreſſion of the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) by the death and bloud of another, and applyed (or a word like it) by the clinging and cleaving of the ſoul to Chriſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now you may take notice that in the two former, this clauſe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>viz.</hi> (But the fiery Deity of Chriſt in the centre of the ſoul) which here is not mentioned<hi>:</hi> Moreover the order is changed, and ſome doubtfull expreſſions are inſerted, which ſhewed his uncertainty four years ſince; all which compared with that Anſwer of his, given by oath at my late Tryal, that this Article was delivered in the ſame expreſs words for the ſubſtance of them, cannot but ſhew that he hath almoſt if not altogether, incurred the ſin of perjury. Now all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well weighed, cannot but demonſtrate that this teſtimony is of no force at all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And although I formerly gave no anſwer to this Article, becauſe it was not ſworn to poſitively, but with reſerves and alterations, and that by one Witneſs only, and came not under the Act of Scandalous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet I ſhall now ſpeak ſomething to it, and ſhew you the Deponents miſtake, which was in leaving out this word (onely) which inſerted, makes it appear with a more innocent face.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But now I ſhall further anſwer, That I delivered this ſentence thus, which I ſtill own, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſecond preparatory work that Chriſt did in the ſoul of a true Saint, for the manifeſting of his glory in it, was the inſtating of the ſoul into a glorious liberty and freedom, which doth not <hi>onely</hi> conſiſt in the liberty and freedom from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the Law, the wrath of God, but alſo in the enjoying of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt in the centre of the ſoul, there purifying our natures, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying our luſts, and reſtoring us into the Image of God: And ſo this truely preſented, is a glorious truth, though as Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> by miſtake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it, it ſeemed monſtrous.</q>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> ſaith that I did deliver, That by male and female, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">Octob. 5.</note> we are to underſtand by male, the Deity, and by female, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and that theſe two became one fleſh;
<note n="k" place="margin">This ſeems to relate to all the former Articles, as well as to this, as may be ſeen in the Charge; but how well it agrees with the anſwers to the croſſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories, let the Reader judge.</note> Theſe things were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered without any limitation whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> being further examined on this Article, to this Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether I ſpake this as my own avowed judgement, or as the judgement of ſome other perſon? Anſwers thus, That I delivered thoſe expreſſions of the Article with approbation; and that therefore he had cauſe to believe it was my judgement, and as far as he remembers, it was delivered as my judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Here the Reader may obſerve that Mr. <hi>Tickle</hi> doth not anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and nakedly as a Chriſtian ſhould, but ſubtilly and indirectly, like a Sophiſter: For he anſwers, that I delivered this with approbation; but whether this approbation was from my ſelf, or from ſome other (I might then cite) he doth not expreſs, paſſing it over in ſilence. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſaith he hath cauſe to believe it was my judgement; which is a meer prevarication, but no anſwer to the queſtion; which was not, Whether he believed it to be my judgement; but, Whether I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as my judgement, or as the judgement of another? To which in the laſt clauſe he anſwers ſomewhat, <hi>viz.</hi> That I delivered it as my own, as far as he remembers: But though this be ſomewhat to the queſtion, yet not much to the purpoſe, it being no legal proof or evidence, for his memory might fail him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now the reaſon of this Interrogatory was, in that Mr.
<hi>Tickle,</hi> ſome four years ſince, when this was better in his memory then now it can be, gave in this that followeth, under his own hand, to the Committee of Plundered Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">This is taken out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions then taken before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</note> That <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. By male we are to underſtand, ſaith Mr. <hi>Pordage,</hi> The Deity, by the female, the Humanity. This he gave from a Rabby, with that approbation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now how conſiſtent this is with his late anſwer to my Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, let all judge, eſpecially with that part of it in which he affirms, that as far as he remembers, I delivered it as my own judgement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But now to anſwer ſomething poſitively to this, which may give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to judicious and knowing Chriſtians, I acknowledge that in the Sermon before mentioned, I delivered for ſubſtance, this which follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That another preparatory work that Chriſt did in the ſoul of a true Chriſtian, for the manifeſting of his own glory in it, was the bringing up the ſpirit of the ſoul into a glorious, myſtical, yet real union with himſelf; and after I had proved the truth and ſubſtantiality of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Chriſt and a Chriſtian, from ſeveral Texts of Scripture, which directly evinced it, I came by way of illuſtration to ſpeak of that Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. out of which I ſaid, that by male and female, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgement of a learned Rabby, The Deity and pure Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might be ſhadowed forth, which by union become one; the male re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Deity, the female the pure Humanity, or regenerated part of the ſoul, which by union is made partaker of the Divine nature.</q>

<note n="e" place="margin">This Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> delivered with this addition: and ſee what ſenſe this is, not underſtanding that there is <hi>oppoſitio relativa</hi> even between the perſons in the Trinity: For Iehovah taken for the Father, is not Iehovah, as taken for the Son; for then there were no perſonal diſtiction; which there is; and ſo a relative oppoſition: which much troubled Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> as he then expreſſed.</note> oppoſition to the Father.</p>

And now conſidering the ſcope of my Sermon at that time, together with the Deponents Depoſition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That he heard me in a Sermon, confeſs that Chriſt was not Jehovah, without adding any more to ſhew how I ſaid it, till I croſs-examined him. I ſay, weighing theſe well together, the judicious Reader cannot but ſee this Deponents envie and partiality; and unfitneſs to take Oath, or be much regarded after Oath, who ſwearing to ſpeak all the truth, dares yet take one ſentence out of a whole diſcourſe, without adding any further explanation of it, to make the Commiſſioners believe that I accuſed my ſelf of blaſphemy at that time, when my whole ſcope was to vindicate my ſelf from the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved imputation of it.</q>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Pordage</hi> being further asked by me, Whether in that Diſpute I did deny that I held Chriſt not to be God? He ſaith the Doctor did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to Mr. <hi>Blagrave,</hi> That Chriſt was God.</p>

               <p>Moreover the former Deponent being asked by me, How I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf in St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Church concerning the Divinity of Chriſt, when I was commanded by the Committee at <hi>Redding,</hi> to explain my ſelf in a Sermon there?

<note n="g" place="margin">In regard I publikely in a Sermon before the Committee renounced the denying the Godhead of Chriſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred the contrary, as my cordial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, though I had formerly denyed the Godhead of Chriſt, which I never did, to have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further trouble about that.</note> eighth and ninth, in regard I was cleared from them, by the vote of the Committee of <hi>Berks,</hi> who had legal power by an Act of Parliament to do it.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. That this Charge of Articles, was not within their cognizance to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe over again, becauſe after a ful hearing and examination of witneſſes on both ſides, (as the diſcharge runs) the Cauſe was diſmiſſed by the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170626:33"/> Committee of plundred Miniſters, two and thirty then ſitting, who had an abſolute power by an Ordinance of Parliament, to put out and to put in Miniſters, and that Objection which through ignorance or craft ſome of them made againſt the diſcharge:
<hi>viz.</hi> That the cauſe was but diſmiſſed, and ſo I not legally diſcharged, is looked upon by judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lawyers to be a meer cavil ariſing from ignorance of the Law, or envy to my perſon, or both: Now the proceeding of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in this againſt former Laws and Statutes unrepealed, eſpecially that weighty one of <hi>Magna Charta, Nemo bis punietur, pro uno deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> is of dangerous conſequence, and much againſt the Liberty of the ſubject, and fit to be taken notice of by the higheſt power of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſo future inconveniences by the infringing of Laws and the exerciſe of Arbitrary power, to the prejudice of tender Conſciences, and the Liberty of the ſubject, may be prevented.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. That not one of the Articles of this Charge, comes within the Cognizance of that Act againſt ſeveral blaſphemous, Atheiſtical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, according to the litteral, and ſo the legal ſenſe of the Act, to which the Commiſſioners are limited as the rule to judge of ſcandal: for firſt, That of Chriſts Imputative Righteouſneſs being ſapleſs, which is the onely Article they can pretend to come within the Act, is not juſtly within the reach of it: for though the Act ſpeaks againſt thoſe that deny the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of God, yet certainly by the ſcope of it, it doth not concern the former Poſition of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Righteouſneſs, for this Act being purpoſely made againſt the Ranters, who entituled God to all unrighteous and evil actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding good and evil, righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, ſaying that all was good, and all God: and ſo made God as unrighteous as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I ſay conſidering this, the words before expreſt cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unnatural wreſting of them, come within that of denying the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God; for though one ſhould be ſo miſtaken as to deny the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, yet it did not follow that one denyed Gods Righteouſneſs, for one might believe God and Chriſt to be righteous, eternally righteous, nay to be righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the abſtract Though one ſhould deny the Imputation of this righteouſneſs; which is onely a relation of that righteouſneſs, as to Saints, and not the righteouſneſs it ſelf abſtractly conſidered: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the Commiſſioners ſhould wreſt every reſerve, the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Clauſe to Imputative righteouſneſs, as they did in my caſe, they might judge any one ſcandalous that differed any way from themſelves in point of Juſtification and Application of this righteouſneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging their denyal of Chriſts imputative righteouſneſs, which might prove a dangerous ſnare to many tender Conſciences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſecondly, none of theſe Articles are within the cognizance of the Act, becauſe all that are judged criminous by that Act muſt avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly maintain, profeſs, or affirm, the things there prohibited, as you may ſee, in pag 980, and 982. where the term <hi>avowedly</hi> is thrice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, now I never avowedly maintained the particulars of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as they are there preſented, but have ſolemnly and publikely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed the contrary, as you may ſee before, and as my proteſtation will ſhew, which I gave in before the Commiſſioners, now how contrary is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170626:33"/> the practice of the preſent Commiſſioners to the intent and ſcope of the judicious compoſers of that Act; who judge none criminous but thoſe that avowedly hold or maintain,

                  <q>4. That this Act was firſt made <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9. 1650. and the Articles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be delivered by Mr <hi>Tickles</hi> Confeſſion, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1649. a year before the being of the Act, now how unreaſonable, and illegal it is for me to be tryed, and accuſed from a Law, for words ſpoken, or pretended to be ſpoken a year before the original birth of it, let all ſober perſons judge.</q>

                  <q>5. According to the concluſion of that Act (p. 934.) no perſons are to be puniſhed, moleſted, impeached, or troubled, for any offence mentioned in that Act, unleſs the ſame perſons be accuſed, preſented, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or convicted, within ſix months after ſuch offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; now Mr <hi>Tickle</hi> confeſſeth in his Anſwer to my General Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory touching the time when the particulars of this Charge were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that according to his beſt remembrance it was about five years ſince; now I was not accuſed within ſix months after that for theſe Articles, which therefore are not within the cognizance of the Act, nor of the Commiſſioners by that Act; for their Ordinance (p. 613.) runs thus, ſuch Miniſters ſhall be accounted ſcandalous in their lives and converſations, as ſhall be proved guilty of holding or maintaining ſuch blaſphemous and execrable opinions, as are <hi>puniſhable</hi> by the Act en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, An Act againſt ſeveral Atheiſtical Opinions, &amp;c. Now theſe Articles are not puniſhable by that Act, for the Reaſon before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore the Commiſſioners cannot legally, though they were clearly proved, judge me ſcandalous for or by them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <q>6.

<note n="h" place="margin">How clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their unjuſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and great partiality, and cruel dealing with me.</note> proteſtation, though made from the integrity of my ſoul, they would not ſuffer openly to be read, but conſulted of it in private, and afterwards ſeemed not at all to regard it.</q>

               <p n="7">
                  <q>7. That the Act of General Pardon, dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 24.
1651. takes away all legal guilt from theſe Articles, according to the judgement of all judicious Lawyers; which alſo clearly appears, by that of page 1547 in that Act in which it is expreſſed, that all offences and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes committed or done, before the third of <hi>September</hi> in the year 1651 in that Act, not afterward excepted, nor forepriſed, are pardoned, which extends as well to words as deeds, as may be ſeen in the ſaid Act; now the particulars of theſe Articles were pretended to be uttered long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1651, and are therefore ineffectual legally to prejudice me. And I ſeeing the bitterneſs and cruelty of my Judges, by their unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170626:34"/> againſt me, to ſtop their mouths, and to leave them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexcuſable, craved the priviledge of this Act of General Pardon though in my own Conſcience I ſtood free from the guilt of thoſe things, they alleadged againſt me. But now having paſſed over my firſt Charge, and having reeapitulated ſome particulars, which may ſerve to clear the Caſe in hand, I ſhall leave it to the judgement of the Reader, whether I ſtand not in my innocency in reference to this Charge, and whether my Judges are not guilty, for condemning me; for ſome particulars of this Charge, as the chief grounds of their ſentence.</q>

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 28.</note> of that ſtate, and ſo be in it; as though they were not in it, living as ſingle though in an united form. This now is my judgement and deliberate practiſe, being according to that of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. 12 <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it;</hi> where he ſpeaks of the the Law of abſtinence, and Chriſtian Eunuchiſm, which theſe words immediately going before ſhew, <hi>viz. There be Eunuchs that have made themſelves Eunuches for the kingdom of Heavens ſake;</hi> Here is the practice and the end of it, which ought to be the growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Gods kingdom in the heart, to which the mortifications of the affections, and the abſtraction of the ſoul from the corrupt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature, do's make way. And, certainly it were well, if Chriſtians, in this corrupt declining age of the world did more eye and imitate the pattern of Chriſts life, who as he was born of a Virgin, ſo lived in virginity, and the ſingle devoted life, leaving an example to all that are able <hi>(Mat.</hi> 29. 12.) to tread in his ſteps, and follow him. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170626:35"/> it is fit for all that are either ſingle or married to conſider, that all private Bonds, Laws, and Engagements, ought to ſtrike ſail to our Higheſt Laws and Engagements to God, and that whenſoever, they croſs one another, the higheſt and ſupreme Law by which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to live to God in purity and integrity, muſt have the precedency. Now my holding forth and declaring this my judgement, together with my own practice, hath given occaſion to many (who are as the Generation before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, and taking complacency in the delights of the fleſh) to ſpeak evil of me, as one that breaks Bonds between Relations, though no ſuch thing can (in truth) be proved againſt me: for it is not my deſign to make proſelites to my judgement, being willing to leave all to the rule of light in their own Conſciences. Though I have ſaid, and cannot but ſay, that it were well if Chriſtians would more labour after, and pray for the gift of Continency, and not in involve themſelves in the entanglements of the world, till they had uſed all means of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication preſcribed in the Holy Scripture, to ſubdue their natures, and it were happy if the preſent Generation, could clearly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe marriages that are Idolatrous, Adulterous, and Beaſtial, and thoſe that are Holy, Pure, Divine, being made in the Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Will, and ſo lawful, and honorable: but alas, moſt people now, are as thoſe in the days of
<hi>Noah,</hi> who being inſenſible of Gods intended Judgement, by the deluge, ſolaced themſelves in the pleaſures and delights of the earth, till the flood came and deſtroyed them. Hence there is much need of ſome at this time, to call people to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and imitation of Chriſts life, to live up to the higheſt and pureſt Rules of Chriſtianity in the mortification of their fleſh, and in the compleat devoting of themſelves to a conſtant attendance upon the Lord, as wayting for his coming in ſpirit, to deſtroy the Man of Sin; and overthrow <hi>Babilon</hi> with all its Idols. So much for the third and laſt particular, which ſhall conclude the things of this Charge.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I am come to the Depoſitions of my third and laſt Charge, ſome of which were taken <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. being the fourth time of my appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the other <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7, and 8. being the fifth and laſt time of my appearing before the Court.</p>
                  <p>But before I preſent the particular Depoſitions, I muſt here inform the Reader of two things, which relate to the laſt time of my

The firſt then is this. The ſeventh of <hi>December</hi> having been taken up in the examination of my witneſſes to the firſt Charge,
<note n="k" place="margin">From an hour or two before dinner, till it was neer nine at night.</note> which continued till it was late in the night, the Commiſſioners called for more lights that they might proceed to the examination of witneſſes in reference to the third Charge, whereupon I replyed it was late, and I had many witneſſes to examine upon the laſt Charge, at this Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> the Accuſer roſe up, and urged the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laſt Charge, ſaying, it would quickly be diſpatched, then the Commiſſioners cryed out, fetch us more Candles, we will make an end of it this night; to which, I replyed, Gentlemen, I have here ſtood ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long before you, and having not dined (through the urgency of my
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170626:35"/> buſineſs) I am not well, being very faint, and much ſpent and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I deſire you would therefore ſtay till the next morning; but they peremptorily denyed this juſt requeſt, and reſolved to proceed. But they permitting me to withdraw for a little ſpace: through emptineſs, and wearineſs, I fell very ſick, and was forced to go into my Bed, at which the Commiſſioners were very much troubled, ſeeming to conſult whether they ſhould proceed to Judgement. The ſecond thing is this, on the morrow the Commiſſioners requiring me, againſt many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which I made, to give in my Interrogatories by writing, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward judged moſt of them dilatory and impertinent to the buſineſs, and ſo not fit to be examined. To which I objected, whatever my proofs were, they ought in juſtice to hear them by examining the witneſſes to my Interrogatories, and afterwards to judge of them, whether valid or invalid. But nothing I could ſpeak prevailed with them, to obſtruct their rejecting

<note n="b" place="margin">Mr <hi>Blagrave</hi> was then at

<hi>Blagrave,</hi> who hath notwithſtanding refuſed to appear.</p>
                  <p>And further, he ſpake thus in open Court againſt Mr

<note n="c" place="margin">He ſpeaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not ſo cruel and unjuſt as he and others are; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, Mr <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> being Chairman, clearedme by vote, after my publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the denial of the Godhead of Chriſt, for which the preſent Commiſſioners, againſt Law and Reaſon, have unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned me. Now whether the accuſer doth not ſpeak more like

                  <p>Note, Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> here asked me ſome queſtions to enſnare me, as, Whether I had not ſeen the viſion of Mr. <hi>Daniel Blagrave?</hi> To which I anſwered, To this profound queſtion I will anſwer when I ſee it atteſted upon Oath.

               <p>Being further asked by Mr <hi>Fowler,</hi> the Dr doth deny that ever any Angel appeared in his clothes, bands, and cuffs, and further ſaith, That his Angel never did appear to him in any viſible ſhape.</p>

But concerning the ſhapes and figures of the ſpirits, you muſt know, they were very monſtrous, terrible, and affrighting to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, Thoſe that drew the clowdy Coaches, appearing in the ſhapes of Lions, Dragons, Elephants, Tygers, Bears, and ſuch like terrible beaſts; beſides the Princes and thoſe that attended them, though all in the ſhapes of men, yet repreſented themſelves monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſhapen, as with ears like thoſe of Cats, cloven feet, ugly legs and bodies, eys fiery, ſharp, and piercing. Now beſides theſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances within, the ſperits made ſome wonderful impreſſions upon vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bodies without: as figures of men and beaſts upon the glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windows, and the Cealings of the houſe, ſome of which yet remain: But what was moſt remarkable, was the whole viſible world repreſented by the ſpirits, upon the Bricks of a Chimney, in the form of two half-Globes, as in the Maps: after which upon other Bricks of the ſame ſame Chimney, was figured a Coach and four horſes, with perſons in it, and a footman attending, all ſeeming to be in motion, with many other ſuch images which were wonderfull exactly done; Now fearing leſt there might be any danger in theſe Images, thorow unknown Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and falſe Magick, we endeavoured to waſh them out with wet cloaths, but could not, finding them ingraven in the ſubſtance of the Bricks, which indeed might have continued till this day, had not our fear and ſuſpicion of witchcraft, and ſome evil deſign of the Divel againſt us in it, cauſed us to deface and obliterate them with hammers. Now what the divels end in the former Apparitions, and theſe figurative repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was, The Lord knows, but it was certainly evil: even as it was againſt Chriſt, when he ſhewed him (in viſion) the kingdoms and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world, to make him fall down and worſhip him, but Gods end in permitting it, was very good, even to bring us neerer to himſelf in a ſtronger dependance upon his eternal power, and to make us more watchful againſt the ſubtilty and power of Satan, as you will ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when I come to ſpeak of the effects of theſe things in reference to our ſpirits. But to thut up this relation of the objects we ſaw in this dark world, I muſt add this, That were but the eys of men open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the kingdom of the Dragon in this world, with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of evil Angels which are everywhere tempting and enſnaring men, they would be amazed, and not dare to be by themſelves, without good Conſciences, and a great aſſurance of the love and favour of God, in protecting them, by the Miniſtration of the Holy Angels.</q>

                     <q>For the Virgin life is not attained till the Will of the ſoul is brought through death to be ſo paſſive as to will, deſire and act nothing but what the Eſſential eſſence of love wills, moves, and acts thorow it; for till then the ſoul cannot be a pure Virgin, nor live without all deſire, luſt, and imagination, which muſt all ceaſe, before the pure life of God can come to be all in all.</q>

<q>This life of Virginity was placed fore-right as to the inward eye of the minde, being that mark of perſecution, at which we were to aym in our preſſing toward the Reſurrection of the dead. To this, Wiſdom that eternal virgin <hi>(Prov.</hi> 8. 20. 23.) as a leading ſtar, invited us, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow her in the way of Circumciſion, Reſignation, and the Croſs, in the way of total ſelf-denyal and forſaking of all for her ſake in the way of annihilation and conformity to Chriſts death, By which we ſaw undoubtedly, we ſhould come to Chriſts Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Glorification, and Fixation in the love of the Holy Ghoſt; the third and laſt diſpenſation. Here we cleerly ſaw the danger of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to the external world, and of putting out our imaginations into the inward world or the kingdom of the Dragon, or of reſting in the openings and delights of the inward light world. For by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back into the delights of the ſenſes, we ſaw the ſoul would become beaſtial, by turning to the left hand, and imagining into the kingdom of the Dragon, in awakening the fire of wrath and ſubtilty: diveliſh and dangerouſly wicked; by turning to the right hand, in imagining into, and taking too much complacency in the viſions, illuminations, tinctures, and Enthuſiaſms, of the light world, we ſaw the ſoul might become elevated into ſelf-conceit, and tinctured with pride, and be in danger of neglecting that death of the Croſs, which is the onely ſafe path, into eternal reſt, and Fixation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Here then we were ſhewed, that the way which lead up to the virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence The new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was ſtrait and narrow; as upon the breadth of an hair; ſo that we were to turn no way, either on the right or left hand, but ſtand without luſt, with our eys fixed upon the Being of love, preſſing forward after fixation in the external houſe of God, there to become immoveable pillars, no more to go out, but there always to bear the name of God, and the name of the City of God, which is the new
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And now for the ſpace of this four years, ever ſince the time of theſe great manifeſtations, we, by the Grace of God, have enjoyed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our ſpiritual ſenſes, which never ſince have been ſhut, neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be, except thorow voluntary tranſgreſſion and diſobedience, we apoſtatiſe and run back into the earthly nature, or turn aſide to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſomething, ſhort of the pure life of virginity, which calls us from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170626:45"/> the external, thorow the internal, into the Eternal world, which is that <hi>kingdom prepared for us from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. But thirdly after the extraordinary time of Grace and Mercy to us we enjoyed not onely a clear leading convicting light upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, but likewiſe received from the Lord a ſtamp and ſtrong impreſſion of power moving our Wills to follow this light through the death of all things, to come up into the perfect life and image of God, that ſo we might be transformed into that righteous nature which we ſo cleerly behold through divine Light: hence we came to live in a greater abſtraction from our ſenſitive nature, in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watchful practiſe of the Croſs, in reference to all external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects, which might by entertaining our Affections, hinder our progreſs to God. Hence alſo we came to live a more devoted, ſtrict, dedicated life, ſequeſtring our ſelves from the world and wordly things giving our ſelves almoſt continually, to prayer, faſting, and waiting upon God, in dying daily to all ſelf-ownments, relations, and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which moſt are intangled, to the great prejudice of their ſpirits; and in this way we have ever ſince continued, endeavouring to be vvholly conformable to the death of Chriſt, in renouncing our ovvn lives, and proper vvills, as oppoſite to the life and vvill of God, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenting thoſe profound myſteries of the Croſs of Chriſt, vvhich are hidden to moſt in the vvorld. But vvhat joy, peace, life, povver, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure, and heavenly Communion, the Lord hath bleſſed us vvith in this our dying reſigning progreſs, I ſhall vvrap up in ſilence, together vvith thoſe bleſſed ſecrets of the kingdom; vvhich in theſe fevv laſt years paſt, vve have been acquainted vvith to the comfort of our ſpirits, in this ſad time vvhen vve are judged and condemned of the vvorld, in the participation of Chriſts ſufferings.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Novv ye Miniſters and Commiſſioners my proſecutors, Is this to be vile? Then let me be more vile. Is this to be contemptible? Even to be reſigned and mortified in the Affections and Paſſions of the ſoul, to give up ones ſelf to a retired devoted life to God in prayer and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual vvatchfulneſs. I ſay, Is this to be contemptible. Then let me be more contemptible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Novv, you have ſeen that I have declared thoſe vvonderful viſions, and exerciſes, vvhich have cauſed ſo many ſcandalous reports, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvith the effects of them on our ſpirits, and I muſt tell you had I a thouſand names, lives, liberties, and ſuch livings as <hi>Bradfield</hi> is; I ſhould rather ſacrifice them all, upon the Altar of obedience, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to it, deny thoſe great and vvonderful things, before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vvhich the Lord permitted, and ordered for his glory, and our good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But ſome may ſay, vvhy did not I before this, declare this great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation to the vvorld? I Anſvver, 1. The Will of God vvas hid from me vvhether I vvas to manifeſt it publikely to the vvorld yea or no; not knovving but that he might afford it as a peculiar mercy to our family, for our private vvalkings before him. 2. That vvhich vveighed much vvith me vvas this. I knevv this manifeſtation vvas but the light and viſion, and not the life it ſelf, and that there vvas light enough in the vvorld already, hence I deſired to keep it private, &amp; not to publiſh it, that I might not have a name without the thing, nor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170626:45"/> declare the light and manifeſtation, without poſſeſſing the life it ſelf, and had not this providential occaſion drawn me forth to bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth, the world had not known ſo much of theſe ſecrets till the name and the thing, the light and the life, the manifeſtation and poſſeſſion had met in union together.
4. We have ſeen ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable examples, of many tall Cedars, who after great manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and high diſcoveries of light, have fallen, and as it were come to nothing. And many ſtars that for a time ſhined bright in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of viſions, revelations, and powerful declarations, we have ſeen ſwept down by the tail of the Dragon, and the ſubtile inſinuations of the Beaſt; ſo that they are now become like other men, living in the earth, and the corruptions of it; now certainly this hath come to paſs for want of perſeverance in the crucifying their natures in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Chriſts death; and by imagining themſelves through Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, to be what they ſaw, before the change and death of their evil natures, whence pride and ſecurity aroſe, and that fall come, in which many now lye: who are as Beacons upon a hill, and torn ſhips upon a rock, to admoniſh us of theſe dangerous paſſages, in which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were loſt: now from theſe Conſiderations, I intended not to have held forth to the world as yet the things I have here declared, but with my family, to have walked cloſe with God, in preſſing after that life, power, and holy nature; which in the coming forth of it, might have convinced all gain-ſayers, that the light and life were in Union toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as I before ſaid, this occaſion hath given me ſome call, to open many of the wonders, then beheld before that time; in which nevertheleſs, the Lord may have ſome bleſſed end, which I may not yet ſee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And now ye Miniſters of <hi>Berks,</hi> my perſecutors, tell me, what wrong or injury I have done you; have I luſted to preach in any of your Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits? Have I privately gone from pariſh to pariſh, or from houſe to houſe to get followers, or make proſelites of your hearers? Have I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely or privately railed againſt you or your Doctrines? Have I not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved privately in my own place, onely holding forth that ſtrict, dying, reſigning life, as the way to life eternal. Why then am I perſecuted with ſo much fury, and violence, as though I were not worthy to live amongſt you. The Lord judge betwixt you and me, and give you to conſider and repent of what you have done; in procuring and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the unjuſt ſentence of ejectment, by which as much as in you lies, you have taken away that with which we have cloathed and fed our ſelves and many others, who have been in want, and ſo expoſed me and mine to outward cares, and troubles, which are very diſagreeable to that life of ſilence, abſtraction, and of continual waiting upon God. In which we live, and are called to live. And what is this but like the task maſters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to force the children of the Covenant, to make Brick without ſtraw? but the Lord is coming to judge himſelf, who will make all theſe things work for my good, which others have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for my hurt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And truly this is all that the Lord Protector and his Council, with the Nation, are beholding to you for, even for haſtening and inviting the pouring forth the vials of wrath upon the Land, by the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170626:46"/> in this time, when ſome or other are continually ſent forth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie up and down the ſtreets, denouncing war, plagues, deſolations, famines, and all ſorts of judgements, and confuſions in Church and State; which will certainly come to paſs, except prevented by a ſpeedy and general repentance in turning to the Lord. But theſe days may be ſhortned by the wonderfull appearing of Chriſt in the power of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to convince and convert ſinners to himſelf, by the preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. And really the eys of many are opened by the Lord to ſee, that the birth of the eternal love and power of the Holy Ghoſt is neer at hand, and that the womb of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love of God is in travel to bring forth Chriſt again in the acting power of his Godhead, which will be that wonder of wonders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of the Prophets and Apoſtles, by which onely the days of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, anguiſh, and diſtreſs, can be ſhortned, and the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the vials of wrath and deſolation prevented, when once they begin to be poured forth upon the earth. And they who are now wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and groaning in their ſpirits, and ſending up the incenſe of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prayers and interceſſions, for the breaking forth of this power, to heal and binde up all the wounds and breaches amongſt Chriſtians, to take away the Curſe from the earth, and reſtore the pure love and unity to the Church, I ſay, they that travel and wait day and night for this great bleſſing are thoſe whom you contemn, perſecute, and reject, as enemies to the kingdom and intereſts. But take heed leſt ye offend one of theſe little ones, and ſo bring a curſe and judgements upon your ſelves, and beware of perſecuting in the way you are now in, leſt in the day of your diſtreſs, the Lord reject you, and give you up to thoſe ſpoilers, who will ſpare neither root nor branch.</q>

                  <p>THat ſhe never knew any thing of the Drs Judgement, neither did he ever bring the deponent into any Judgement; and that ſhe had never any diſcourſe with the Dr till ſhe did firſt begin with him; and that if ever he had confirmed her in any thing, it was in nothing diſagreeable to the word of God.</p>

But this I aſſure you, If ever any ſuch language fell from me (which truely I do not remember) it was ſpoken as relating to that Charge he lay under at that time, raiſed by ſome who ſeem to know mens meanings and opinions better then I do. In ſhort, this I do affirm, and ſhall readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteſt upon Oath, when required, That the Dr hath ſeveral times moſt ſolemnly avowed the contrary, and to me by Scripture under his own hand, evinced it. For the truth is, I have with much boldneſs charged the Dr with things of that nature having received them upon report; but upon debate he hath given me ſuch clear ſatisfaction, both touching the Divinity of Chriſt, and other matters of faith, of the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that I have ſtood ſilent, having nothing to object againſt him; I did therefore apprehend it a duty incumbent upon me, thus to write; for as I will never be inſtrumental to clear him in what he is guilty, ſo not to condemn him wherein I believe he is innnocent.</p>

<note n="b" place="margin">This croſſeth his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</note> denied, ſaying, it was a Tympany, and that ſhe remained there till betwixt Eaſter and Whitſontide, where and when ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, and ſhe did not deſire any ſtore of company to come to her labour, though the Deponents wife did deſire it; and after ſhe had been a ſhort time delivered, the Dr came and baptized the child in the Deponents Chamber, and named it <hi>Hannah;</hi> and after that, the Dr called the Deponent aſide into his Orchard, and prayed him to find out a private place, two or three miles from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents houſe, where the ſaid Mrs <hi>Flavel</hi> might come now and then to ſee her child. The Deponent ſaid it would be inconvenient, becauſe it was a time of Souldiers, and the Corn was high, and thereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent did not look out as he deſired.

                              <p>THat about nine years ago Dr <hi>Pordage</hi> brought a Gentlewoman, by name, Mrs <hi>Fruen,</hi> behind him from <hi>London,</hi> as he ſaid, to one <hi>Roger Laughtons</hi> houſe, a Smith in <hi>Heſton Pariſh;</hi> that the ſaid Mrs <hi>Fruen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him her ſelf for her boarding.</p>

                              <p>That her firſt husbands name was Mr <hi>Flavel,</hi> and that ſhe had had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond husband, by name Mr <hi>Fruen,</hi> who alſo was then dead.</p>
                              <p>That the cauſe of her private living there was, in that her brother in Law threatned he would have her body, if it were above ground, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in Law with him.</p>
                              <p>That at the ſame time the Dr owned that he dwelt at

                              <p>That ſhe told him, for his ſecurity, he might enquire at the Bulwark by the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he might know that ſhe had there an Eſtate in houſes.</p>

                  <p>This was delivered into the Court after <hi>Laughton</hi> had finiſhed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but they would not ſuffer it to be enrolled among the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it in ſome particulars croſſing
<hi>Laughtons</hi> preſent teſtimony, and in others, tending to clear the truth, in reference to the occaſion of Mrs <hi>Flavels</hi> being there. But the accuſer asking him whether he would not ſtand to his preſent Depoſition? He ſaid, yea. Whereupon the Clerk returning me the Paper again, wrote this at the bottom of it, <hi>Mr</hi> Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>acknowledgeth the two Letters,</hi> R. L. <hi>to be his writing, but will ſtick to what he hath now depoſed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>There was not a word altered after he had ſubſcribed the Paper, as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170626:49"/> two Witneſſes then preſent could atteſt by Oath. Now the particulars in which he croſſeth himſelf, cannot be all true. And if a man will ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly own and ſubſcribe an untruth, he may after ſwear an untruth: But the confeſſion here wrote laſt, is much to be regarded, being he owned and ſubſcribed it before the other, being then in a calm, ſober poſture: But the other he depoſed after my adverſaries had been a whole day tampering with him at the Bear in
<hi>Redding,</hi> and poſſeſſing him with prejudice againſt me, which he openly ſhewed in the Court, by bitter expreſſions, and by thoſe circumſtances in the former Depoſition, which tend to blaſt the Gentlewomans good name and reputation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But for further ſatisfaction, 1. I refer you to my Anſwer, in which I have largely ſhewed the reaſons of her privat retirement there, which may in juſtice clear me from that undeſerved aſperſion my enemies have caſt upon me.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>2. Conſider that this, as to me, is no legal proof of any crime, but a meer circumſtantial thing, brought to raiſe ſuſpitions and prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, being but of the nature of a Libel, and ſo unfit to have been received into a judicious Court; for, whoſe name and reputation may not be blaſted, if ſuch libellous illegal things, ſo long paſt, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Courts of Judicature, as accuſations to condemn them?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>3. Though that crime which my accuſer would render me ſuſpected for, by this circumſtantial Depoſition, had been ever ſo clearly proved, yet the date of it (being 9 or ten years ſince) had put it quite out of the cognizance of the Commiſſioners; not only by the Act of general par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but alſo by another Law made particularly by the Parliament, in reference to things of this nature, which takes away all legal guilt from any perſons that are not accuſed within a year after the commiſſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch crime, beſides the Act to which the Commiſſioners are confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as their rule to judge of ſcandal, was made many years ſince; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, they neither had, nor have any power to take a buſineſs ſo long paſt, though otherwiſe ever ſo criminal, into their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</q>

                  <p>Note,
<q>As I own and imbrace the Hiſtorical birth, life, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt without us, with the bleſſed effects of them, clearly held forth in the Goſpel, ſo do I alſo believe the myſtical birth, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt in us, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 50. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.

This was about two years ſince, as far as this Deponent can remember; and the Deponent ſaith he judged the ſame contrary to the mind of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>Had the Commiſſioners allowed me ſo much time as to have brought in what evidence I could, againſt this mans depoſition, I ſhould have proved, that in the tenor of my Miniſtry, I never denied or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the hiſtorical and litteral ſence of the Scriptures, for which there can be no juſt ground.
<note n="*" place="margin">As in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, where I ſaid, that by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> houſhold in the letter, was meant his external houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>viz.</hi> his wife, children, and ſervants; but in the myſtery, his internal, <hi>viz.</hi> his mind, will, affections, and inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> But that I have uſually joyned the litteral and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical interpretation together, even as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Gal.</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170626:50"/> Deponent miſtakes in ſaying I excluded the Hiſtory; for I had before opened it in the plain Hiſtorical ſence; and afterward came to open it myſtically, in making a ſpiritually moral uſe of thoſe Scriptures, in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the work of God upon the inward man.</q>

In regard I objected againſt him as a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and ſo an inſufficient Witneſs. 3. In that there was no concurrent teſtimony. 4. In that he wrote not this down, and ſo could not exactly deliver ſo much, word for word, as I ſpake it, eſpecially ſo long after ſome part of it was delivered; and ſo by a little miſtake, might preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate my ſenſe and meaning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Deponent further ſaith, That Goodwife <hi>Knap</hi> told him about a moneth ſince, that ſhe being at the Drs houſe, Mrs

<note place="margin">This was part of this <hi>Haſtlets</hi> Depoſition, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not the former head.

                  <p>Note,

To this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion he anſwereth, That it was one Mrs <hi>Flavel;</hi> and he further ſaith, that above four years ſince Mrs <hi>Flavel</hi> was very earneſt in prayer, on a day when they were faſting, which was at the time when one
<hi>Seywood</hi> came to the dore; the ſaid <hi>Seywood</hi> knocking, the Deponent went to the dore to him<hi>:</hi> And he ſaith he doth acknowledge that <hi>Richard Seywood</hi> did come to him (about the time mentioned in the Examination of the ſaid <hi>Seywood)</hi> to the Parſonage of
<hi>Stanford;</hi> and he ſaith it is probable he did ask the ſaid
<hi>Seywood</hi> what he did think of the noiſe he heard in the Drs houſe the day before? And that when the ſaid <hi>Seyword</hi> anſwered to this foregoing queſtion, he could not tell, it is very probable the Deponent did relate to him, that the Lord was doing a great work in this Kingdom, and to this Nation, and doth confeſs that unadviſedly he told the ſaid
<hi>Seywood,</hi> that the cauſe of the foreſaid cry was one in travel; but doth not remember he ſpake any ſuch thing, as that the pains were ſo extream, as that, had he ſtayed longer, he might have heard it as far as the Town; but doth confeſs that he ſaid ſhe was in travel of a manchild, and that he and many others were eye-witneſſes of it.</p>
                  <p>And being asked who it was that was in travel? He anſwered, Mrs <hi>Flavel.</hi> And being further asked what became of this manchild? He
<note place="margin">The Deponent in this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, was ſet upon by the Miniſters with ſo many queſtions, that he could ſcarce come to the buſineſs which was to declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was a natural, or a ſpiritual tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, which at laſt he clearly expreſſeth, by ſhewing it was no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral travel.</note> anſwereth, it was the birth, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt in her nature. And being asked how the birth, death and reſurrection of Chriſt, in the nature of Mrs <hi>Flavel,</hi> was ſo great a work, that God was doing to this Nation? He anſwereth, he never ſaid any ſuch thing: And being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked, whether himſelf (being demanded what this manchild was) did not anſwer, The child of Reformation?</p>
                  <p>To this he anſwereth negatively.</p>
                  <p>He further ſaith, That this travel of a manchild was not any natural birth of a child out of the womb; but the cry that was then made; was nothing elſe but the groanings and interceſſions of the Spirit in her prayer.</p>
                  <p>Note,
<q>This laſt part is the real truth of the buſineſs, which I could have proved by many Witneſſes more, who were preſent in my houſe at the time, and whom I had ready before the Court, to atteſt upon Oath, that there was no natural travel, nor any natural birth, nor any ſuch child born; but only the Gentlewoman was then very earneſt in prayer; but this was thought ſuperfluous, being that the Deponent Mr <hi>Pordage,</hi> from the miſtake of whoſe diſcourſe, this came to be made an Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, cleared the buſineſs himſelf by Oath. But how my name hath ſuffered from this groundleſs buſineſs, is known very well, both to my friends and enemies, ſome of which, as the accuſer Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> for one, in open Court, ſcoffed at me, threatning to prove great things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me from this Depoſition of <hi>Seywoods.</hi>

                  <p>That a Summons being iſſued for the appearance of
<hi>Suſanna Day,</hi> the Meſſenger went for her, and met with her on Tueſday night laſt, being the fifth inſtant, at the Deponents houſe, and that ſhe was willing to come, and could not in regard of her diſtemper at preſent; but the ſaid <hi>Suſanna</hi> (having reported to ſeveral people in <hi>Abbington,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Deponents wife, that ſhe was at Dr <hi>Pordages</hi> houſe, and that the people there told her her eyes were opened, and ſhe ſaid ſhe ſaw at that time the new Jeruſalem to come down from heaven all of precious ſtones, and ſo on, according as in the Article.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Suſanna</hi> told the Deponent on the ſaid Tueſday night, that the laſt time ſhe was at the Drs houſe, ſhe ſaw the new Jeruſalem to come

<hi>Starkey</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by me, recited all the Evidence, with much acuteneſs, method, and judgement; ſhewing, That if they ſquared their proceedings by the rules of Law they were to act by, they could have no ground to give ſentence againſt me; which he demonſtrated ſo clearly, by ennumerating both the teſtimonies on both ſides, and alſo the particular Laws and Priviledges which freed me from the imputation of any legal guilt, that many, though prejudiced perſons, were much ſtaggered, doubting of the iſſue, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſentence. But after this Speech, we were all commanded to withdraw; and about an hour and an half after, we were called in again, and the Regiſter was commanded to proceed to publication<hi>:</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Depoſitions on both ſides were read. Which being done, Mr <hi>Ford</hi> was ordered by the Commiſſioners, to make a Speech in juſtification of their intended Sentence againſt me; which Office he performed as wretchedly, as he undertook it willingly, miſ-repreſenting the Evidence with confuſed Paraphraſes and miſtakes, labouring to refute the Law of my Councels Speech, with ſuch aſſertions as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That although many of the proofs brought againſt the Doctor, were not proofs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, yet to the Commiſſioners, who are a Court of Equity, and of an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and ſo not obliged to judge according to poſitive Laws and Statutes, they were, and might be eſtemed ſufficient proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Many ſuch ſpeeches as theſe he uſed, contrary to the Liberty of the Subject, the rule of Reaſon and Scripture, endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people, I was as monſtrous, as he and ſome others had repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in their Pulpits and diſcourſes; but I ſhall ſay no more of him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170626:52"/> and his ſpeech, leaving them both to the righteous Judge of all things, who one day will juſtifie, whom he, and others of his way have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this Speech of Mr <hi>Fords</hi> was ended, I deſired liberty of Mr <hi>Dunch,</hi> the Chairman, to ſpeak ſomething to the people, in reply to ſome things Mr <hi>Ford</hi> had untruely ſaid againſt me; but it would not be permitted.</p>
               <p>Then I deſired them to receive in this my laſt requeſt, and to weigh it ſeriouſly, before they proceeded to ſentence; which though it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into my hand again before it was read, I ſhall here preſent for the ſatisfaction of the judicious Reader.</p>

                           <p>BEfore you proceed to Judgement, and paſs ſentence, I deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider theſe ſubſequent particulars.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That I was according to Law acquitted of that Charge atteſted by Mr <hi>Tickle,</hi> whence I produced my Diſcharge before you, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgement of judicious Lawyers is undoubtedly legal, and will hold good, notwithſtanding all pretentions to the contrary.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That the matters of the ſame Charge are acknowledged by the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have been ſpoken a year before that Act was made, Entituled, <hi>An Act againſt ſeveral Blaſphemous, Atheiſtical Opinions,</hi> to which the Commiſſion refers, as the rule to judge of ſcandalous opinions, which make a diſtinct head from matters of ignorance and inſufficiency, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenor of the Commiſſion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That the ſame Act cannot take into cognizance any crime for which the offender was not accuſed within ſix months after the committing of it; therefore nothing in either the firſt or laſt charge that hath been any way proved, can be judged as an offence againſt that Act.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In reference to my third or laſt Charge, there hath been nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly proved againſt me; but ſome words and expreſſions dropt from me in a privat diſcourſe to one ſingle Witneſs<hi>:</hi> Which expreſſions, as you
<note place="margin">Mrs <hi>Grip,</hi> who had been proved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, had I had juſtice</note> ſee, are capable of an harmleſs interpretation, being never owned in that ſence the Witneſs took them; as my avowed judgement, but ſolemnly diſowned, as contrary to it, and therefore incapable legally to prejudice me; for the former Act doth not make one an offender for a word, but for avowedly maintaining or holding forth in words or writing, any thing there prohibited</p>
                           <p n="5">5. That in reference to thoſe words in both my Charges, which have been any way proved to have fallen from me, I never owned them as my Judgement, in that ſence my accuſer takes them; but have openly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſowned them, which therefore cannot render me guilty, either by the Law of that former Act, or by the Law of Scripture, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth judgement againſt thoſe who make a man an offender for a word,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 20, 21. which deſerves your ſerious conſideration.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. That the particular Articles both of my firſt and laſt Charge, that ſeem to be of worſt conſequence, cannot juſtly be brought within the cognizance of that Act, according to the litteral and genuine ſcope of it, being chiefly made againſt the Principles and Practices of thoſe called Ranters.</p>
                           <p n="7">
                              <pb n="94" facs="tcp:170626:53"/> 7. That nothing of ſcandal in life and converſation being proved againſt me, my free owning and confeſſing the appearance of evil Spirits for ſome time in my Family, permitted by God, oppoſed and overcome by the Chriſtian weapons of Prayer and faſting, ought not in equity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice any againſt me, ſo as to ſway them in their Sentence or Judgement, I having cordially, ſolemnly, and ſincerely proteſted my innocency, as to any communion or compact with evil ſpirits, and that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that things of this nature, though criminous, are not under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the Act, but to be tryed by the common Law, according to the uſual cuſtom of this Nation.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. That the Act of general pardon doth clearly take away all legal guilt from things done or ſpoken before 1651. that are not excepted in the ſaid Pardon. Now the particulars of my firſt Charge, and all thoſe of my third or laſt, which ſeem to be of moment, and to be any way proved, were ſpoken or done before the year 1651.
<note n="b" place="margin">And therefore made invalid, by its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note> Now this being the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Judgement of able Lawyers, who have ſeen it experienced in things of more dangerous conſequence, may give you the Commiſſioners ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of ſerious reflections upon it.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. That (according to the judgement of wiſe, judicious, and knowing men, your Commiſſion having been long ſince, and being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain under conſideration and debate, Whether to be confirmed or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) You the Commiſſioners in the interim have not compleat power to act, eſpecially in reference to Sentence, Judgement, and Execution; which I believe is the reaſon why ſo few of the Commiſſioners have ſate, and why others that were at firſt ſo earneſt in their proceedings, have ſince withdrawn themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. That in reference to Judgement and Sentence concerning me, Scandal ought to be preſerved as an abſolute diſtinct Head from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Inſufficiency, according to the Letter of your Commiſſion, and the undoubted Judgement and intent of the Authors.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. That the Teſtimony of any one, though by Oath, concerning what another related to him touching a third perſon <hi>(i. e.</hi> the Defendant) is no proof at all according to Law, being not ſo much as concurrent teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny if the Defendant deny it, and do not own it himſelf: Moreover, That the Teſtimony Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> gave, is not legally valid; becauſe, beſides the former reaſon, he is the Accuſer, and incapable to be witneſs, according to Law.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. That in the day of ſentence, Mr
<hi>Dunch</hi> and Mr <hi>Trapham,</hi> cannot by Law ſit as Judges, becauſe they condemned me long before proof,
<note place="margin">All here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, ſate as Judges and Aſſiſtants at the time of ſentence.</note> threatning me before Witneſs, to turn me out of my Living, at the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Parliament; and the laſt was a Witneſs againſt me. That Mr
<hi>Fowler,</hi> Mr <hi>Woodbridg,</hi> and Mr <hi>Tickle,</hi> cannot by Law, fit as Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to the Judges, or give their Votes in the day of Sentence, the one being my accuſer, the other two Witneſſes againſt me.</p>

               <p>After I had delivered this to be read, and had received it again, we all withdrew; and about two hours after were called in again; when the Room being full of people, one Mr <hi>Lee</hi> a Miniſter, the graveſt man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, began a very formal ſpeech to me, in which he very Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically expreſſed what a grief
<note n="b" place="margin">If this was ſo, why was I ſentenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law?</note> and trouble it was to them to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt me, and that he durſt not judge that I then was guilty of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170626:53"/> holding thoſe monſtrous Tenents I was accuſed of; yet they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>ſecundum</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">It had been well if they had done ſo.</note> 
                  <hi>alegata, &amp; probata.</hi> Afterward he proceeded to give me many exhortations, and ſecret reproofs, in which he with much artifice made me guilty of all I was accuſed of. Whereupon, after I had heard him for a pretty ſpace, being very ſenſible of his diſguiſed prejudicing diſcourſe, and his deſigne in it, I was forced to ſtop him, by replying, That if he had any brotherly exhortations to give me, he might come in private with me; but thus to pretend to admoniſh and exhort me, yet really to repreſent me as guilty of all I was accuſed of, and that before the people, was the cuſtom of the Scribes and Phariſees, who were wont to hide foul deſigns under ſuch fair colours; witneſs their dealings with Chriſt: whence I deſired him to ſpare his admonitions, and to leave off twiſting ſuch ſilken halters, ſaying I was prepared for Sentence, and that I deſired him and the reſt to take heed of condemning and betraying the innocent,: Upon this, the man being ſtruck ſomewhat ſilent, Mr
<hi>Dunch</hi> the Chairman, commanded the Regiſter to do his Office; who preſently read the ſentence of my Ejectment in the open Court, which was then very brief, though afterwards enlarged with many circumſtantial aggravations, and great untruths, as this following Copy ſent to me from the Clerk, on the next day after my ſentence, clearly ſhews.</p>

                     </note> witneſſes, that ſwear poſitively, I limited the propoſitions of Chriſts not being God and Jehovah, in that diſpute in which they were ſpoke, explaining them as relating to God the Father, even as Mr <hi>Trapham,</hi> though a witneſs againſt me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in his Depoſition. Moreover, My witneſſes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that I owned Chriſt to be God in the ſame diſcourſe, before the Committee. Secondly, After this, in a Sermon before that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, I vindicated my ſelf from that aſperſion, owning Chriſt to be God and Jehovah, as my cordial and avowed judgement, upon which the Committee cleared me by vote; and truely this had been enough to have freed me from any future prejudice as to that particular, though I had before been guilty of holding that monſtrous Tenent, as I never was. Thirdly, In my Proteſtation I have ſolemnly owned the Deity of Chriſt as my judgement, renouncing the contrary Opinion; Fourthly, If I were guilty of this, it muſt be as it is an offence againſt the Act of Scandal, which is the Commiſſioners rule in things of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, but it is not an offence againſt that Act, in regard the words I am accuſed of, were ſpoken in the year 1649. and the Act made 1650 Fifthly, My Diſcharge, together with the Act of General Pardon, free me from the pretended guilt. Now let theſe particulars be weighed together in the ballance of equity, and the great untruth of the Commiſſioners Aſſertion, cannot but clearly appear.</p>

                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> The falſity of this will be diſcovered, if we do but conſider, that this Aſſertion muſt be grounded, either upon the Accuſers or Mrs <hi>Grips</hi> Teſtimony, The Accuſers was this, That one told him, that I had ſaid the blood of Chriſt was not Meritorious of any mans ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now this was as untrue as illegal, being a meer ſcandal and a meer hearſay of the Accuſers, which therefore is of no force. and can give no juſt ground to the former Aſſertion. The Teſtimony of Mrs <hi>Grip</hi> was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170626:55"/> this, that I told her it was a poor thing to live upon the blood of Chriſt. Now that this is no ſufficient ground for their formen Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That I am guilty of denying the Merit of Chriſts precious blood, will clearly appear if you conſider, Firſt, That this Aſſertion in the whole latitude of it is not falſe. for if it be applyed to thoſe who erroneouſly ſo live on the blood of Chriſt as to neglect the following of Chriſt in Mortification, and ſelf denyal as I feared this woman did, and on that account applyed it to her, I ſay, if it be ſo applyed, it is a real truth. Now I averring that I delivered this not in general, but with a particular reſpect to Mrs <hi>Grip</hi> and others that I apprehended abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the precious blood of Chriſt, how dare they pretend ſo to judge of my inward thoughts and intentions as to condemn me as guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Merits of Chriſts blood for ſuch a ſpeech. Secondly
<note n="l" place="margin">As you may ſee before. My Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo ſhews, that I do not hold &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, and to am not guilty by the Ordinance, which reſpects the preſent time.</note> Theſe words were atteſted but by one ſingle witneſs, who committed Perjury, and ſo invalidated her own Teſtimony. Thirdly, Theſe words are no offence againſt the Act of Scandal, whether you conſider their nature or time, as to the laſt it is clear they are not within the reach of the Act becauſe I was not accuſed within ſix months after they were ſpoke, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above four years ſince, as to the firſt, there is nothing about the blood of Chriſt expreſſed in the Act, which was chiefly made againſt the opinions and practices of the Ranters.

<note n="m" place="margin">Though the words were ſpoke, yet I preſently ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them up, confeſſing, it was <hi>Lapſus Linguae,</hi> or a ſlip of my ſpeech, as one of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes depoſeth.</note> I ſaid I would not ſtand to the word, <hi>but,</hi> nor

Secondly, Though this had been ſo, yet the Commiſſioners could not have touched, or condemned me as guilty for it; 1. Becauſe this was one of the Articles I was acquitted of by the Committee of plundered Miniſters.
2. It was ſpoken ſome

For not to ſpeak of the illegality of Mr <hi>Fowlers</hi> being permitted to be a witneſs, being my Accuſer, all that was ſaid to this, was by Mr

But ſecondly, Admit I ſpake, even as my enemies pretend, yet the Commiſſioners had no power to retroſpect to words ſpoken ſix yeers ſince, for the Ordinance by which they are to act, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely thoſe who ſhall be found <hi>HOLDING OR MAINTAINING</hi> &amp;c. Now they cannot ſay that <hi>I hold or maintain this,</hi> being I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared otherwiſe in my

Fourthly, This was long before the Act of Oblivion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fifthly, The diſcharge I received from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of plundred Miniſters, takes away all legal guilt from this Article and puts it paſt the Cognizance of theſe Commiſſioners.

                     <hi>me from the fact, and that it doth onely diſmiſs the cauſe out of that Court,</hi> The Reader muſt know this vail and pretence, comes either from ignorance or ſubtilty; for it is not there expreſſed, that the cauſe was diſmiſſed out of the Court, but
<hi>Ordered that the Cauſe ſhould be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which is general, and it is there added, The ſame is hereby diſmiſſed;</hi> Now the diſmiſſion of the Cauſe on the Defendants part, doth really
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170626:56"/> diſcharge from the fact, as thoſe that have knowledge in the Law, and are acquainted with the proceedings in Chancery, and other Courts known very well, and if you read the diſcharge (pag. 4.) you will finde it very full, for 'tis there expreſſed, <hi>That upon hearing the Cauſe in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of parties and Council on both ſides,—and upon a full Hearing what could be ſaid by both parties, This Committee order the ſaid Cauſe to be diſmiſſed,</hi> &amp;c. And though it be pretended the reaſon of diſmiſſion was becauſe they had no proper cognizance of the cauſe, and were not inveſted with power to Eject; It is a great untruth, for the reaſon was becauſe they could prove nothing worthy of ejectment againſt me, for had they found ſufficient ground, I had as ſurely been ejected, as I was acquitted, as it is well known to thoſe who were at the tryal. But to conclude, the thirty two members of Parliament, who were of that Committee at my tryal, many of which came much prejudiced againſt me by the falſe reports of my adverſaries, knew better their own power, then to receive ſuch a formal tryal of a cauſe they had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cognizance of, and to give ſuch a ſerious and full diſmiſſion of it.

Now was it not a ſad thing, that a man of this ſpirit, ſhould be one of the aſſiſtants, acting the part of a Judge all the tryal, with great influence upon the proceedings; and be alſo witneſs, and accuſe altogether?

And as the Councellors tell me, this was ſufficient to have put him paſt the capacity of Being a Judge, both in equity and Law, yet he was Chair-man at Sentence, and was very induſtrious and rigid a-againſt me thorowout the tryal; and to ſpeak my Conſcience of him, I believe that thorow the over perſwaſions and prejudicing inſinuations of ſome

As to the firſt, Let his own words, uttered with much zeal in the open Court, ſpeak for him, which were theſe, <hi>I never heard of any other death or Reſurrection of Chriſt, but what was at Jeruſalem,</hi> Which ſhewed he had never read, or at leaſt underſtood theſe Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. Secondly, As to the temper of his affections, that hath been cleerly diſcovered, by his ſaying,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170626:58"/> He <hi>q</hi> could as willingly run his ſword into the bowels of ſuch as I, as
<note place="margin">b This was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken four yeers ſince before a Committee, &amp; related again by himſelf at my tryal, at leaſt three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times.</note> into the bowels of a common enemy; as likewiſe by his practiſe ſince the tryal, in which he hath continually endeavoured to poſſeſs all he diſcourſes with, that I am ſo monſtrous, as ſcarce worthy to live upon the earth: But beſides theſe things, he was a witneſs againſt me, and ſo upon that account, unfit to be judge, according to the common courſe of Law. Now beſides theſe two, there were not enough to make up a Court according to the Ordinance, there being but four more.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, One of which four vvas Mr <hi>Cook</hi> of
<hi>Wallingford,</hi> of vvhom I ſhall ſay no more but this, that his late action of ſupplanting and outing of Mr <hi>Wyer</hi> by ſubtilty, vvho is a godly honeſt man, ſhevvs vvhat he is, vvhich buſineſs is very vvell knovvn to the godly party about <hi>Wallingford,</hi> being much reſented, and condemned by them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>A fourth vvas Mr <hi>Nutkins,</hi> vvhoſe blinde zeal and rigidneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is vvell knovvn to tender moderate Chriſtians, and vvas clearly diſcovered by his carriage to me, and bitterneſs againſt me in my laſt tryal. The inconſiſtency, and contradiction of vvhoſe actions, ſhevv his unfitneſs to be a Judge in ſuch caſes of vveight and concernment; for ſome four years ſince being of the Committe of
<hi>Berks,</hi> and after a Sermon preached before the ſaid Committee, I had vindicated my ſelf from that of denying the Godhead of Chriſt, he gave me his vote to clear me of that Imputation, confeſſing he vvas ſatisfyed, after he had asked me a queſtion or tvvo touching ſome particulars in my Sermon; vvho novv, notvvithſtanding this, hath condemned me for the ſame thing he then voted me clear of; although nothing more touching the Godhead of Chriſt hath ſince been proved againſt me, vvhich is the chief thing they ſtood upon, as they themſelves have confeſſed; in reference to this Sentence. But vvhence theſe contradictory acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have proceeded, vvhether from the late perſvvaſions and inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Accuſer and others, I do not knovv. But this I am ſure of, vvith thoſe that carryed things tenderly and juſtly he appeared ſo to; and vvith thoſe, that have ſince carryed themſelves rigidly and unjuſtly, he is one likevviſe in his actings. But hovv theſe carriages of his can be truly reconciled, I do not unſterſtand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tvvo more there vvere, vvho though appearing more moderate then the reſt, yet ſubſcribed the Sentence, being carryed avvay by the ſtream of the others violent perſvvaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But before I conclude and ſhut up this part concerning thoſe that ſubſcribed the Sentence, I cannot but ſpeak ſomething of Mr <hi>Arthur Evelin,</hi> vvho though he vvas not preſent vvhen Sentence vvas given, yet vvas a Commiſſioner, and ſate amongſt the reſt one day of my try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſeeming to carry things very fairly, though in truth he vvas a chief contriver of the deſign againſt me, vvho after he had laid his plot and ſet the vvheels of others paſſion and falſe zeal in motion, vvithdrevv himſelf, as though he vvere not engaged in the buſineſs; but he knovving there vvere enough to ſerve his deſign, in carrying things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me all the tryal, prejudiced me another vvay, in preparing both in the Country, and <hi>London</hi> all he met vvith, to believe I vvas ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170626:58"/> and monſtrous, as to deſerve, if not death, yet at leaſt that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Ejectment, which he knew would be paſſed againſt me; and really tis not to be uttered what wrong and injury he hath done me, by his railing accuſations, for tis well known that he hath been induſtrious in repreſenting me as one of the worſt of men, making me more vile and baſe, if it be poſſible, then the Jews and Ethnicks, by falſe and dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſions, made the Apoſtles, who yet were eſteemed by them, as the

This I have been forced to ſpeak, that I might do juſtice in defending innocency, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſubtilty, having not the leaſt envy againſt the perſon of Mr <hi>Evelyn,</hi> whom I ſo far love as to pray for his conviction, and the right informing of his underſtanding, touching that innocency which he now condemns as guilt, that ſo he may repent and turn to the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the remiſſion of his ſins, before he goes hence, and be no more ſeen.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I have finiſhed the Tryal, and all thoſe circumſtances relating to it, which might any way ſerve to clear the truth, and ſo diſpoſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, as to be able to give true Judgement in my Caſe; and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but by what is here related, out of no other end, but to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lay open both truth and falſhood, innocency and ſubtilty, it will clearly appear, that my enemies, both in their accuſations, management of the Tryal, and Judgement, after evidence on both ſides, have neither obſerved the Law of Nature, the Law of this Nation, nor the Royal Law of Love; but have ſteered their proceedings by prejudicate reſolutions, and arbitrary determinations, which were as illegally concluded by their ſentence, as uncharitably ſet on foot and begun by intereſt, miſtake, and blind zeal and envy; which I am confident will one day be as manifeſt as the light, when the vails and pretentions with which they have covered their own eyes, and the eyes of many others ſhall come to be rent away. In the mean time if what I have here wrote, is not through that preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, which is ſucked in by moſt, ſufficient to clear that truth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency I own and live to, I ſhall contentedly lie under the cenſures and condemnation of men, as that in which I am conformable to Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, waiting for that righteous judgement of God, which will juſtifie the truely innocent, and condemn the really guilty.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in the former Diſcourſe diſpatched my Tryal before the Committee of <hi>Berks,</hi> I ſhall now preſent you with ſomething more, referring to the ſame buſineſs, in which I ſhall inform you, 1. What I have proceeded in ſince my Sentence, 2. I ſhall lay down ſome Grounds or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why, in anſwer to thoſe who have much cenſured me for it. 3. I ſhall ſhew the iſſue and event of it, and ſo conclude all.</p>
            <p>1. You muſt know then, after the Sentence of Ejectment was paſſed againſt me, being ſenſible of the injuſtice and illegality of it, and that great injury, which by it was done to that Cauſe of God, and Life of Chriſt which I own and live to, I was moved from my own ſpirit, and encouraged by others, to addreſs an Appeal to his Highneſs the Lord Protector, who (with his Councel) made the Ordinance by which the Commiſſioners were impowered to act. So I came to <hi>London,</hi> and framed a Petition in the uſual way, in manner of an Appeal, in which I preſented my grievance to the Protector, believing it very reaſonable, in caſe of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and wrong, to appeal from an inferior Court, to that Power which Conſtituted them, and gave them being. Now in the time of my waiting upon, and expectation of the delivery of my Petition, I met with many who were much againſt it, as a thing too conformable to the cuſtom of the world, and too ſlaviſh for thoſe who are to live to the life of Chriſt, out of the waies and obſervations of <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo that I have been excepted againſt, 1. in reference to the perſon, or perſons to whom I appealed, as to my owning of, and bowing to ſuch a Power. 2. In reference to the ends for which.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Particular.</hi> As to the firſt, touching my owning of, and appeal to the chief Magiſtrate for the execution of Juſtice, and relieving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I ſhall here ſhew my grounds upon which I go.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis my Judgement then, That in every Principle according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order, and Gods Will, there ſhould be Superiority and Inferiority, Rulers, and Ruled, Higher and Lower, even as there are.</p>
            <p>For firſt, If we look into the Kingdom of darkneſs, we ſhall find there great diſtinctions and degrees amongſt the fallen Angels, there being <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 6. 12.) Principalities, Powers, and the Rulers of this dark world. And Dignities, <hi>Jud.</hi> 1. 9. There is alſo one Supreme Prince, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24. Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils, called
<hi>(Rev.</hi> 9. 11.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The Angel of the Abyſſe, or bottomleſs pit; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. The Dragon, who with his Angels under him, war againſt <hi>Michael;</hi> he is alſo called, <hi>Apollyon,</hi> Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are they, who as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, are reſerved in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170626:59"/> everlaſting Chains under darkneſs, being the Lords Vaſſals. But that their order, their ſuperiority and inferiority, is not peculiar to them, as they are fallen, is clear, in that, before they fell, they were inveſted with a Principality, <hi>Iud.</hi> 6. The Angels that kept not (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, as in the Original.</p>
            <p>2. That there is ſuperiority and inferiority, &amp; great diſtinction in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical World, or Heaven of the Angels, is clear from Scripture, ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. there is mention made of
<hi>Michael,</hi> who is cal'd one (or the firſt) of the chief Princes, for that there are more chief Princes beſides himſelf, of which,
<hi>Gabriel,</hi> who ſpake this to <hi>Daniel,</hi> queſtionleſs was one: And Chriſt ſpeaks of more then twelve Legions of Angels, which Legions muſt have their chief Captains and Leaders. Now Gods Hoſt of Angels hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny names of diſtinction in Scripture, ſuitable to their offices, ſtrength, or beauty: As 1. We find Angels, which may be a general name belonging to all, as they are the Lords Meſſengers. 2. Arch-Angels,
<hi>Iud.</hi> 9. 31. 3. Cherubims, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10. 20. 4. Seraphims,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 2. 5. Thrones. 6. Dominions, 7. Principalities, 8. Powers,

                  </gap>.</note> 1. 21. where the diſtinguiſhing appellations of the Angels are in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. in the plural number<hi>:</hi> But by this we ſee there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, diſtinctions, ſuperiority, and inferiority, amongſt thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enjoy and obey God.</p>
            <p>And further, if we look into this outward world, we ſhall find there ever have been, and ſtill are, Governors, and Governed, Superiors and Inferiors, though in ſeveral forms and models of Government; and theſe diſtinctions we find not only in thoſe States, whoſe policy is continned by the rules of mans reaſon, but even amongſt the Jews, once the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people of the Lord, who by his immediate deſignement, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Gideon, David, Solomon, &amp;c.</hi> to rule and govern the Iſraelites.</p>
            <p>Now things being thus ordered by Divine Providence, we may, nay ſhould own all diſtinctions and degrees, according to the nature of that principle in which they ſtand, and from which they ſpring. We are not to revile the Devils themſelves, nor to ſpeak evil of thoſe Dignities which
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jude</hi> 8.</note> are in the Abyſſe or dark world; for, <hi>Iud.</hi> 9. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel durſt not bring railing accuſations againſt the Devil, but ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Truely the fallen Angels are Gods Vaſſals, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of his wrath and fierce anger, and ſo are to be owned as Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Principalities, Powers, and Rulers in their own ſphear and principle, even as the Scripture diſtinguiſheth them; though all their wickedneſs, ſubtilty, malice, and temptations are utterly to be rejected, as oppoſing the righteouſneſs and holineſs of God.</p>
            <p>Now if we are to own, <hi>i. e.</hi> to take notice of, and not contemn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the Dignities, Principalities, and Powers of the dark world; how much more the Orders, diſtinctions, and degrees of this world, though made according to the rules of the ſpirit of the world? <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the wiſe Canons of rational policy and humane foreſight. And though Governors and Rulers may be of three ſorts; as firſt, ſuch who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conſtituted and inveſted with honour and power by the Lord, as
<hi>Moſes, Aaron, Ioſhua, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Such as are in power and honour, by a lawfull ſucceſſion, or a free Election of the people, or their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170626:60"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Such who out of neceſſity, policy, or ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume power and Authority to themſelves; I ſay, though there are theſe three ſorts, yet we have no warrant from reaſon or Scripture, to reſiſt, revile, ſlight, or not to own, <hi>i. e.</hi> acknowledge any of them, to be in their own ſphear, what really they are: for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5.

Concerning the Saints bowing
<note n="b" place="margin">Although thoſe who out of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſcruple it, ought to be tenderly dealt with, being we find not that our Saviour uſed theſe cuſtoms before <hi>Pilat,</hi> whom ſome may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And furthermore, when we are oppreſſed and injured by any inferior Magiſtrates, we may appeal to the ſuperior Power, for the execution of Juſtice. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> knowing the malice of the Jews, and ſeeing what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they had upon the Provincial Governors to ſway them, appealed to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the Supreme Magiſtrate, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 11.
<hi>No man may deliver me unto them, I appeal unto Ceſar.</hi> Where you ſee he made uſe of a Law or cuſtom of the Romans, to free himſelf from oppreſſion and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. And
<note n="d" place="margin">As appears from the end of Magiſtracy,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2, 3. For theſe ends ſubjection is requiſite to their Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces prudenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made for the preſervation of States and Commonwealths in peace.</note> certainly it is very reaſonable for the Saints of God, when they are injured againſt Law and equity, to preſent their grievance to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Magiſtrates, for the execution of their own Laws upon thoſe, who pretending to act from them, break and violate them.</p>
            <p>Now in the performing of thoſe three particulars before expreſſed, it doth not follow, that we own and make our ſelves members of Babylon, or the external bodies of confuſion and irregularity; for here is no evil Idolatrous complyance with it, in acting the things before expreſſed: For, as <hi>Abraham</hi> could bow in civility to the Heathen people, and
<hi>Paul</hi> give the Ethnick Princes their Titles, and appeal for Juſtice to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Tyrant, without ſinfull complyance, or owning himſelf of and in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with their corrupt ſocieties; ſo may we do the ſame things, though
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170626:60"/> we were amongſt the worſt and moſt corrupt Babylonian Magiſtrates in the world, without any ſinfull union and complyance with them. And though <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. the Lord thus calls,
<hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues;</hi> which is enough to ſtirr us up to a ſerious enquiry, what it is to come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and how farr it extends; yet I ſay, ſome things are abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite whilſt we live in the place of Babylon, even as theſe before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and are really conſiſtent with our obeying that Scripture, in forſaking the evil of Babylon, though we live in the place of it. For as there was no neceſſity for the Jews that lived in Ethnick Babylon, to partake of the ſins of Babylon,
<note n="a" place="margin">Nehem. 2. 7, 8. Dan. 4. 19. <hi>My Lord,</hi> 22. <hi>O King.</hi>
               </note> though they performed the civil acts before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo there is no neceſſity for thoſe who are in Chriſtian Babylon, to partake of the ſins and iniquities of it, though they perform thoſe civil and neceſſary actions before recited, which are required of us in reference to the external commerce, and protection of our bodies, in the places where we live.</p>
            <p>But now having ſhewed the juſt grounds of appeal, in caſe of wrong, to ſuperior Magiſtrates, and the reaſons why they are to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubmitted to, I ſhall proceed to give an account of thoſe ends in my Appeal, which are ſo much excepted againſt by ſome.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>End.</hi> The firſt end then which is ſo much decryed againſt, is my petitioning to keep and be longer poſſeſſed of a Parſonage and Tythes, which is a ſcandal to many, as being a legal and forced maintenance, and a continuing my ſelf in a way of Preaching for hire.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, 1. In reference to Tythes, which I confeſs hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have much doubted of my ſelf, as to the receiving of them, and that upon ſeveral accounts, as that there was no ſuch maintenance in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive time, when Chriſtians and Churches were pure, and that they were forced by a Law, without the good will of many that pay them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which confideration, and ſome others, which heretofore ſeemed weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to me, I have thought good to

As to my

               <hi>End.</hi> 2. Another End which is excepted againſt, both in my appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing is, the vindicating of my own perſon and cauſe, from dark and falſe aſperſions; as though it argued weakneſs and irreſignation in me; in not being able to ſuffer the ſcandals, cenſures, and reproaches of the world, without ſuch endeavours to vindicate my ſelf and the truth, which God in his time, as they ſay, will clear.</p>
            <p>But to this I anſwer, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 1. <hi>There is a time to keep ſilence, and a time to ſpeak, v.</hi> 7. Some years laſt paſt have been a time of ſilence to me, in which I have ſuffered under all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſcandals and reproaches, through the malice of the Devil, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170626:61"/> any endeavours of vindication; but the enmity of my enemies grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a height, as not to contain it ſelf within the limits of railings, revilings, ſlanders and reproaches, but that alſo breaking forth into a formal accuſation, tryal and illegal condemnation, and Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that external livelihood which the Lord hath beſtowed upon me, and that under the pretence of juſtice, merit, and deſert: I ſay conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I eſteemed it juſt and righteous, to appeal for a re-hearing, that truth &amp; inocency might not lie wrapt in the vails of unjuſt condemnation, and lying reports, and that malice, ſubtilty, and illegal proceedings, might come to be detected, and no longer blind the eyes of many, who judge both of my enemies and my ſelf, according to the falſe glaſs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which I believed might tend much to the glory of God, and the ſhame of him who is the father of lies, who hath ever endeavoured to ſtrengthen his falſe intereſt, by raiſing undue prejudices againſt the truth, and the ſincere owners of it; ſo that the endeavouring a re-hearing, and the publiſhing the truth of things, for the ends before expreſſed, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of pure wiſdom, and Chriſtian prudence, being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, who after he had appeared two or three times to anſwer for himſelf before the Roman Governors, and ſeeing <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Jews, and upon that account willing to try him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> amongſt them, where he believed they would have condemned his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and made him ſuffer as an evil-doer<hi>:</hi> I ſay, on that account, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 10, 11. he appealed to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> deſiring to be tryed at his Judgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, hoping there to have his innocent cauſe and perſon cleared. And 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2, 3. we find <hi>Paul</hi> vindicating himſelf againſt the unjuſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thoſe who thought he walked according to the fleſh: So that where theſe things are done from a good and ſincere principle, they are good, and not juſtly to be excepted againſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been objected, that we ſhould leave thoſe things to God<hi>:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Our performing theſe things for his glory, and in obedience to his will, doth not take them out of Gods hands; for what good we do in obedience, he doth it in and through us <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13.) who are but his inſtruments, and obliged to uſe lawfull means for the accompliſhing of lawfull ends, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
            <p>And having now exhibited the grounds and ends of my Appeal, and demonſtrated the reaſonableneſs of it in reference to both, I ſhall proceed to ſhew the iſſue and event of my appealing.</p>
            <p>You muſt know then, that after I had waited about ſeven weeks, my Petition was delivered by Mr
<note n="a" place="margin">After it came into his hands, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</note> 
               <hi>Sadler</hi> (one of the Maſters of Requeſts) to his Highneſs the Lord Protector, who granted a reference to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel;
<note n="b" place="margin">on Friday morning, <hi>Feb.</hi> 9</note> and ſhortly after, my Petition, with the Reference ſubſcribed, was delivered by a worthy friend into the Councel; which after a great debate, though ſome of the greateſt eminency were for it, rejected it, and would by no means grant a re-hearing of my Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now this was the iſſue of my eight weeks waiting in
<hi>London;</hi> which, I confeſs, though in ſubmiſſion to providence, I with many others, looked upon as very hard and unreaſonable; becauſe in point of wrong and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is according to the Law of Nations, and the rule of pure reaſon and juſtice, that there ſhould be an Appeal granted from inferior Courts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170626:62"/> of Judicature, to that Power which gave them being, eſpecially in a thing of ſo great concernment, as the Ejecting and throwing men out of their Eſtates and Livelihoods.</p>
            <p>But here I cannot but inform the Reader how ſubtilly and cruelly my enemies have dealt with me, not only in condemning me againſt Law, but likewiſe in uſing all means poſſible, to prevent the granting of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal for the re-hearing of my Cauſe, for tis very well known that they have induſtriouſly laboured to poſſeſs all (in whoſe power it is, and who ought in this ſad and extraordinary caſe to relieve me, and grant a re-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) with unſpeakable prejudices, inſinuating into them, that I am ſo guilty and vile, as unworthy to be regarded in my addreſſes to them.</p>
            <p>Now to a diſcerning eye, this courſe of theirs, in labouring ſo much to prevent a re-hearing of my Cauſe, ſpeaks thus much, That they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid their unjuſt and illegal proceedings will be detected by it, and many of them proved great lyars and ſlanderers, for reporting I am guilty of ſuch horrid crimes, as they commonly ſay they proved againſt me. Now if they did not fear this, why ſhould they be ſo much ingaged in ſtriving by theſe inſinuations, to prevent the granting of an Appeal? For if I were really as they repreſent me, all that I ſhould get by a re-hearing, would be, to be twice condemned, and that with double diſgrace, and an open juſtifying of their ſentence againſt me; whereas now I have this to ſay, That they condemned me unjuſtly, ſteering their proceedings nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they by Law, Reaſon, nor Scripture.</p>
            <p>But being as yet rejected of men, and deprived of the juſt priviledg of an Appeal on earth, I ſhall appeal to heaven, from time to eternity, from the double eye of the Creature, to the ſingle eye of God.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Eternal Majeſty, thou art that high and holy one who ſeeſt clearly, and judgeſt truely thou ſearcheſt my heart, and tryeſt my reins, pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my inmoſt thoughts, and most ſecret motions with the ſingle eye of thy glory: All things within and without ſtand naked and unvailed before thee, being more then tranſparent to thy all-diſcerning ſight; I therefore appeal from mans day, Iudgement, and condemning Sentence, to thy day, Iudgement, and acquitting voice; from mans dark erroneous ſight, to thy penetrating, clear, all-ſeeing eye. Thou knoweſt I am not guilty of theſe Blaſphemies and horrid things laid to my charge; Thou knoweſt that my ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proteſtation is from the ſincerity of my heart; Thou knoweſt that it never entred into the intention of my ſoul, to deny the holy Trinity, or the Godhead of Chriſt, whom I own to be God coequal, and coeternal with the Father; Thou knowest I am not guilty of holding that Chriſt was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or that his righteouſneſs is not a fruitfull, powerfull, everlaſting righteouſneſs, or that his bloud is not cleanſing, meriting, reconciling bloud. Thou ſeeſt how my innocency, in reference to theſe things is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with the dark clouds of falſe aſperſions, and undue accuſations. Othou bright Eye of Divine Glory, doſt not thou ſee and behold the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſufferings of my perſon, name, Eſtate and Family for thy ſake? Doſt not thou know that I have been oft caſt into the Den of Lyons, and into the fiery Furnace of wrath and envy, for thy names ſake? O gracious God, how oft have I been reviled, numbred amongſt tranſgreſſors, made as a ſcorn and odium amongſt men, looked upon as the off-ſcouring of the</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:170626:62"/> 
                  <hi>earth, and now at laſt civilly put to death, caſt out of their Synagogues, and by unjuſt entence, ejected out of that Eſtate which was thy gift, and all this for thy truth and life? O bleſſed Majeſtie, doſt not thou behold the naked ſimplicity, and ſimple innocency of thy ſervants ſpirit? who to the utmoſt of his power, reſigns up his body, ſoul and ſpirit, to follow the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous Law of Sanctity, Purity, and Virginity, through the mortification of the ſences, the crucifying of the old man, and the caſting away of the body of ſin, in conformity to the croſs, death and reſurrection of Chriſt, that ſo at length by the ſupply and vertue of thy ſpirit, there might be an actual conqueſt attained over ſin, hel and death. O thou Eye of Eternity, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt my will reſigned to thine, without moving this way or that, as to the permanency of, or freedom from theſe ſufferings. O my God, thou knoweſt I can neither deſire the continuing cenſures and condemnation of the world, nor the juſtification of my perſon and thy cauſe from the mouthes of the juſt, though in pure obedience to thy will, calling me to it; I have addreſſed my ſelf to the higher Powers, that they might be left inexcuſable, and have by writing exhibited the innocency of that life, imbodied in fleſh, which by the envy and ſubtilty of Satan, hath been ſo much levelled at, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded by the miſts and arrows of wrath and darkneſs. And now I ſtand reſigned in obedience to thy will, the true rule of righteouſneſs, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a publick ſigne, and witneſs-bearer of Chriſts ſufferings, and to be made yet more vile and contemptible for his ſake, who enduring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the ſhame, now ſits enthroned at thy own right hand. O omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Majeſtie, thou knoweſt we are neither the better nor the worſe for the juſtification or condemnation of our fellow-creatures; there is no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in man, or the things of man; therefore the ſpirit of thy ſervant flyes to thee, like a dove into the true Ark of reſt, to be caught up into thy eye, and to be taken into thy heart, and boſom-love; for in ſuch union oft lies union of hearts, union of wils, and union of ſpirits, there is ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only. O how my ſoul groans after this union with thee, and preſential enjoyment of thee, O my God, even to feed continually on the tree of life, to live in the day, and light of thy glory, to ſee and behold the beauties of thy inmoſt holy habitation, to eat, yea to banquet on Chriſts fleſh, and to drink, and that abundantly of his holy bloud, to be repleniſhed and drencht through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with the wine and oyle of the holy Ghoſt; for the full enjoyment of which, thy ſervant ſhall continually wait upon thee, retiring from the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Cisterns of the Creature, to thee the Fountain of all good, to whom, with thy eternal Son and holy Spirit, be rendred of Saints, Angels, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, glory, praiſe, and Halleluiahs for ever.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Now I have run through the ſubſtantials of my Appendix, in which I have exhibited the reaſons, grounds, and iſſue of my appeal, the laſt of which hath been a denial of affording me a re-hearing, whence I am forced to appeal to the juſt Judge of heaven and earth, who will certainly render to every one according to his works, even reward and honour to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but judgement and diſgrace to the guilty; and though my adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may yet proceed to add iniquity to iniquity, even to juſtifie by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what they have moſt unjuſtly acted againſt me, yet I ſhall have much peace in my conſcience in what I have here done, to ſhew impartially the truth of things, however the prejudiced world ſteere their judgement of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170626:63"/> me, which cannot but be very hard and injurious, if they believe that late
