blamed her for having children by her husband, and argued with her the unlawfulneſs of having children by her husband.

      * Art. 3. In his diſcourſe to Mr. Lewin
concerning the ſame ſubject, he endeavoured to maintain the unlawfulneſs of their having children, and ſaid that Adam was Male and Female in himſelf, and had he not fallen he had brought forth children himſelf, and to maintain and prove the ſame by Scripture and otherwiſe.

      * Artic. 4. In his diſcourſe with Mr Lewin,

      * Artic. 5. The ſaid Doctor Pordage hath had for ſome weeks together in his houſe the ſaid Everard and one Tawny, who ſtiled himſelf King of the Jews, who had been queſtioned as it is generally reported, for holding dangerous and unſound Opinions, as that there is no Hell, and the like.

      * Artic. 2. THat Jeſus Chriſt was not perfect, alleadging that Text to confirm it, he cryed out My God my God, why
&c.
